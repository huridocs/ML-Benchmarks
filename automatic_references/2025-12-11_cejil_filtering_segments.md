On  July  15,  2003,  the  Inter-American  Commission  on  Human  Rights  (hereinafter “ the Commission ” or “ the IACHR ” ) received a petition 1 on behalf of several officers of the National Police of Ecuador — Jorge  Villarroel  Merino,  Mario  Rommel  Cevallos  Moreno,  Jorge  Coloma  Gaybor,  Fernando  López  Ortiz, Amílcar  Ascazubi  Albán,  and  Patricio  Vinuesa  Pánchez — (hereinafter “ the  alleged  victims ” ),  alleging  the responsibility of the Republic of Ecuador (hereinafter “ the State ” or “ Ecuador ” ) for the alleged violation of the rights enshrined in Articles 1.1 (obligation to respect rights), 7 (personal liberty), 8 (right to a fair trial), 9 (principle of legality and freedom from ex post facto laws), 10 (compensation), 11 (privacy), 21 (property), 24 (equal protection), and 25 (judicial protection) of the American Convention on Human Rights (hereinafter “ the American Convention ” or “ the Convention ” ) and in Articles I (life, liberty, and personal security), II (equality before the law), XVIII (fair trial), XXV (protection against arbitrary arrest), and XXVI (due process of law) of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (hereinafter “ the Declaration ” ) in criminal proceedings for the offense of embezzlement brought against the alleged victims.

Similarity: 0.4491
Text: 13. The petitioner adds that there was a change in the CNJP ’ s composition and, on May 26, 2003, the new President issued a “ grounded deed ” ordering the “ firm arrest ” and seizure of the assets of eight accused individuals, including the alleged victims. He claims that the President based this decision on a mix of articles from police codes and common criminal codes.

Similarity: 0.4760
Text: 14. The petitioner states that, following the arrest of the alleged victims, 4 an amparo remedy for their release was filed, claiming that the mechanism of “ firm arrest ” did not exist under police law and stating that the President of the CNJP had applied an article that came into force following the commencement of the proceedings. 5 He adds that on July 3, 2003, the release amparo was denied and that the alleged victims were kept under arrest in spite of a resolution of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated January 23, 2004, ruling that “ firm arrest ” was not applicable to people whose trials had begun before the new code came into force.

Similarity: 0.4859
Text: 5 The  petitioner  reports  that  the  first  transitory  article  of  the  common  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  as  amended,  states  that proceedings commenced prior to the date of its date of entry into force shall continue under the previous rules, except when an individual would benefit from the new provisions.

Text: 28. The State contends that the alleged victims were judged by the appropriate venue and, if they had any disagreement with former President Pinto, the Law of the Judicial Function of the National Police was available  to  them  for  challenging  his  position  as  president.  Ecuador  states  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  the petitioner having filed an administrative action with the competent authority in connection with that matter. Similarly, regarding the failure of the Minister of the Interior and Police to intervene, it notes that the minister had no jurisdiction to participate directly in the alleged victims ’ criminal trial and, had he done so, he would have assumed functions that did not correspond to his office, thereby incurring in a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. In addition, Ecuador maintains that the judges acted with full independence and impartiality in the legal proceedings and at all times due process was upheld.

In  addition,  the  State  contends  the  petitioner  incurs  in  inconsistency  and “ bad  faith ” by arguing that the case was judged by a flawed inquisitorial system, considering that in August 2007 Mr. Villarroel assumed the presidency of the CNJP. Finally, the State asks the Commission to rule the petition inadmissible for not meeting the requirements set in Articles 46 and 47  of the Convention and for not establishing deficient actions on the part of the agencies of justice.

Text: 4. Thereafter,  according  to  the  petitioners,  senators  and  political  leaders  began  to  look  for grounds on which to impeach the alleged victims. To that end, the petitioners said, an office was set up in the Chamber of Deputies where the public could file complaints. They indicated that on November 18, 2003, the party leaders in the Chamber of Deputies filed articles of impeachment against the two alleged victims, along with Justices Luis Lezcano Claude and Felipe Santiago Paredes, citing 20 disciplinary counts. The petitioners stated that these last two justices resigned rather than be impeached.

Similarity: 0.4739
Text: 5. The petitioners stated that on November 25, 2003, as there was no impeachment law setting out  the  rules  of  procedure  for  carrying  out  the  impeachment  process  contemplated  in  Article  225  of  the Paraguayan Constitution, the Senate passed Resolution No. 122, establishing a set of rules for the impeachment trial. The rules did not allow for recusals and guaranteed only two business days to gather evidence to refute the charges and three hours to present their defense.

Similarity: 0.4173
Text: 18. The State noted that the alleged victims ’ improper performance of their duties needed to be investigated, and so a procedure was approved to do that via Resolution No. 122. The State argued that the alleged victims were tried in accordance with all procedural guarantees. Specifically, the State indicated that the  legislative  branch  ensured  the  alleged  victims  the  right  of  defense  and  gave  them  the  opportunity  to introduce evidence to refute the charges. The State said that although the Rules of Procedure granted only a 48-hour period to review the articles of impeachment, the Impeachment Committee had forwarded these to the defendants on November 12, 2003, which means that the alleged victims had a total of 18 days between notification and the presentation of their defense.

Text: 21. The State indicated that 14 of the 20 counts against the alleged victims were dropped not for lack of grounds but because presenting the evidence to prove those charges would have taken much more time. With respect to article of impeachment 1, concerning a decision by which the justices determined that their own appointments were for life, the State called that decision a “ legal heresy .”

Text: 22. With respect to article of impeachment 2, concerning the deviation from the procedure for confirming judges, the State noted that the impeached justices did not interpret the case put to them; instead, they  delivered  a “twisted” interpretation  that  misrepresented  the  Constitution.  With  respect  to  count  4, concerning  interference  in  the  functions  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  the  State  argued  that  the  law  was stretched  in  order  to  grant  a  measure  that  was  in  violation  of  the  Constitution.  With  respect  to  count  5, concerning the failure to meet procedural deadlines, the State argued that the impeached justices’ conduct was one  of  complete  indolence  and  negligence.  With  respect  to  count  7,  concerning  interference  in  legislative authority and upsetting the principle of balance of power, the State argued that the impeached justices had issued a ruling with erga omnes effects, which it said went against the Constitution. Finally, with respect to count  14,  in  which  the  State  was  convicted  and  ordered  to  pay  damages,  the  State  indicated  that “all good citizens in Paraguay regarded the suit ( … ) as treasonous. ”

Agreements and Judgments 222 and 223, both  issued  by  the  Supreme  Court  on  May  5,  2000,  ruled  in  favor  of,  first,  an  action  of unconstitutionality advanced by Justices FELIPE SANTIAGO PAREDES and JERÓNIMO IRALA BURGOS  and,  second,  an  action  advanced  by  Dr.  ENRIQUE  SOSA  ELIZECHE,  both  of  which challenged Resolution No. 421, issued by the Senate on November 5, 1999; Decree No. 6131, issued by the Executive Branch on November 9, 1999; and Article 19 of Law No. 609/15.

Text: (….) Judges brought an action of unconstitutionality (…) requesting a finding of inapplicability regarding the rule requiring judges who aspire to be confirmed in their posts to appear again before the Council of the Judiciary (….) . The Court, in its Agreement and Judgment No. 1033 of December  19,  2001,  rejected  the  suit.  However,  in  the  resolution  section  it  introduced  an unusual decision that has no constitutional basis. Indeed, the ruling in question provides (…) that the Council of the Judiciary may not exclude from a shortlist of three candidates any Judge who presents him or herself for competition hoping to be confirmed to the post (…) . In no article of the Constitution is it established that the Council of the Judiciary must include on a candidate  shortlist  judges  who  present  themselves  for  confirmation.  Moreover,  the Constitution established a procedure that explicitly requires judges to compete for their posts at least two more times after they are appointed, to secure tenure in office.

Text: (…) 7. Usurpation of constitutional authorities expressly reserved for the Legislative Branch, seriously upsetting the balance of power established in Article 3 of the Constitution, which constitutes the punishable offense of an “ attack on the constitutional order.” The  Supreme Court,  sitting en  banc , (…) by  Agreement  and  Judgment  No.  979  of  September  18,  2002, decided  to (…) rule  in  favor  of  an  action  brought  by  the  Attorney  General  challenging  the constitutionality of Article 5 of Law No. 1444/99 “ On Transition, ” within the scope established in the last part of Article 137 of the National Constitution (…) . The Supreme Court strayed from  the  explicit  and  specific  mandates  of  the  National  Constitution,  encroaching  on  the precise and explicit sphere of another branch of government (due to either clear ignorance of the law or intentional omission), more precisely attributing to itself legislative powers that are the exclusive purview of the National Congress (…)

Text: (…) 14.  The  Case  of  Mundy  Recepciones  or “ Croquetas  de  Oro ” (“Gold Croquettes”) .  The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court (…) on February 28, 2002, issued Agreement and Judgment No. 62, rejecting the action brought by ITAIPU Binacional that challenged the constitutionality of S.D. No. 305 of April 9, 2001 (…) and Agreement and Judgment No. 101 of August 9 of that same year (…) which resulted in a judgment against ITAIPU BINACIONAL for the  sum  [in  local  currency,    guaranis]  of  TEN  BILLION  FIVE  HUNDRED  NINETY-SEVEN MILLION,  FIVE  HUNDRED  SEVENTEEN  THOUSAND,  FIVE  HUNDRED  SEVENTY-FIVE GUARANIS (…) .  Considering  the  notorious  speed  with  which  the  case  in  question  was conducted, there are serious indications of bias, more so considering that one of the lawyers for the plaintiff was none other than the brother of Justice Carlos Fernández Gadea. Beyond the  speed  of  the  case,  which  could  constitute  improper  performance  of  duties,  the aforementioned conduct falls under the crime of malfeasance established in Article 305 of the Criminal Code. 9
