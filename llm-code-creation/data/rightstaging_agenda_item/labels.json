Millions who live in homelessness or unacceptable living conditions have no\nplace where they can claim their right to housing when States have failed to progressively\nrealize the right, imposed forced evictions, or criminalized those who live in homelessness\nor in informal housing. She argues that the outdated division of the right to housing into\njusticiable and non-justiciable components, negative and positive rights, must be firmly\nrejected. Ten key normative principles are identified which States must satisfy to ensure\nthat all components of the right to housing are subject to effective remedies. The Special\nRapporteur outlines how compliance with the obligation to progressively realize the right to\nhousing is adjudicated; how forced evictions and criminalization must be prevented\nthrough access to justice and participation in decision-making; how national human rights\ninstitutions and informal justice systems should complement the role of courts; and how\nprivate actors are required to ensure access to justice for the realization of the right to\nhousing.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.19-00608(E)\n\n\n\n",

However, in spite of the wide\nrecognition of its crucial importance, the right to a healthy environment has not yet been\nrecognized as such at the global level.

He highlights the different State obligations in\nrelation to the right to breathe clean air, which are both procedural and substantive, as well\nas the specific obligation to protect people and groups in vulnerable situations.

Based on the existing human rights\nobligations and responsibilities of States and other actors, the guiding principles underline\nthe importance of systematically assessing the impact of economic reforms on the\nenjoyment of all human rights before decisions are taken to implement such reforms, as\nwell as during and after their implementation. Economic policymaking must be anchored in\nand guided by substantive and procedural human rights standards, and human rights impact\nassessments are a crucial process that enables States and other actors to ensure that\neconomic reforms advance, rather than hinder, the enjoyment of human rights by all.\n\nGE.18-22303(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report provides an overview of the barriers youth face in enjoying their rights\nto access and participate in the labour market. It highlights that to tackle those barriers\nStates should put in place concerted legislative, policy and budgetary measures with a\nstrong gender lens, not only in the area of the right to work, but also in the area of\ninterrelated and interdependent rights, such as the right to social security, the right to\neducation and the right to participate in public affairs. This approach fosters youth’s\nempowerment and requires a fundamental shift to lay out the conditions for promoting\nyoung people as agents of their own future, change and progress.\n\nGE.18-22389(E)\n\n\n\n",

In the report, the Independent Expert highlights\na progressive improvement of the human rights context, while noting considerable\nchallenges that negate the full realization of human rights in Somalia. The positive\ndevelopments include the process of establishing the National Human Rights Commission\nand the fact that Somalia ceased the inhumane practice of public executions in Mogadishu\nof persons sentenced to death.\nThe many challenges that remain include the continued violation of the rights to\nfreedom of expression and opinion, by both the federal and State security forces, the\nviolation of the rights of internally displaced persons, the absence of a legal framework for\nthe protection of persons with disabilities and the plight of the rights of children who had\nbeen abducted by Al-Shabaab and subsequently recaptured or who had escaped. Somalia\nretains the death penalty despite having accepted the recommendations made in 2011 as\npart of the universal periodic review process to adopt a moratorium.\nOther challenges include the continued existence of sexual and gender-based\nviolence, in spite of campaigns and the implementation of the joint communiqué between\nthe Federal Government of Somalia and the United Nations on the prevention of sexual\nviolence, concluded on 7 May 2013. Al-Shabaab remains a potent threat in spite of the\ncontinued fight by troops from the Somalia National Security Forces and the African Union\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). The group has continued to carry out acts of terrorism,\nsuch as the 14 October 2017 bombing in Mogadishu that left hundreds of civilians dead. It\nalso targets public officials and extorts taxes from the civilian population in areas under its\ncontrol.\nSomalia is still undergoing transition in its governance and the peacebuilding\nprocess. It has witnessed progress as well as setbacks in the political, social and economic\nspheres, which have included the removal of high-placed State officials from public office.\nWithin a period of few weeks, the Speaker of Parliament and Chief Justice were removed\nfrom office. Somalia has observed a neutral stance vis-à-vis the Gulf crisis, thus avoiding\npotential destabilization owing its historical connections and proximity to the region.\n\nGE.18-12001(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report\ncovers the period from July 2017 to June 2018 and describes the overall evolution of the\nhuman rights situation in the Central African Republic and the major developments\naffecting it.\nThe period was marked by constant human rights violations and abuses linked to\ncontinuing attacks by various armed groups in the south-west of the country in 2017, and in\nBangui and the centre of the country in 2018. Most of the abuses were the work of antiBalaka and ex-Séléka armed factions and criminal gangs controlling districts of Bangui or\nmining areas. They continued to target civilians, humanitarian workers and United Nations\npeacekeepers, but also homes, public buildings, hospitals and places of worship, worsening\nthe humanitarian situation and restricting access to economic and social rights. These\nincidents also show contempt for the rules of international humanitarian law on the part of\nthe perpetrators of these attacks, Unacceptable cases of sexual violence and cruel,\ndegrading and inhuman treatment still go unprosecuted. Despite the ratification of the\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of\nchildren in armed conflict, serious violations of the rights of children persist.\nThe African Union launched the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in\nthe Central African Republic in July 2017, and the Economic Community of Central\nAfrican States (ECCAS) has strengthened its involvement in the stabilization of the Central\nAfrican Republic and regional security. Doubts nonetheless remain as to the sincerity of the\narmed groups regarding their commitments to this process and the disarmament,\ndemobilization, reintegration and repatriation programmes. The population is demanding\ngreater participation in this process.\nCrucial steps have been taken in transitional justice regarding the pillars of justice,\nthe right to truth and guarantees of non-recurrence, but they lack coordination and\ncoherence. The appointment of the members of the National Commission on Human Rights\nand Fundamental Freedoms certainly represents progress in the construction of an\ninstitutional human rights framework, but it requires consolidation through evaluations and\nan adequate budget.\n\nGE.18-13342 (E)\n\n290818\n\n\n\n",

In her report, the Special Rapporteur also refers to the\nrole of private employment agencies and to positive measures taken by Member States to\nprotect against domestic servitude.\nTo prevent human rights violations including servitude in the domestic sector,\npolicies are needed that tackle discrimination while also helping to balance the legitimate\nconcerns of both employers and workers. A sustainable domestic work economy should\nensure access to justice, effective enforcement and remedies in the case of exploitation\nand abuse, while also addressing issues of prejudice against migrants through advocacy.\nIn her recommendations, the Special Rapporteur advises States on how to\neffectively prevent and combat domestic servitude by ensuring the protection of migrant\nwomen and their access to decent work.\n\nGE.18-12469(E)\n\n\n\n",

Contemporary\nmanifestations of Nazism and neo-Nazism constitute continuing human rights and\ndemocratic challenges, and the Special Rapporteur recalls the applicable international\nhuman rights legal framework in this context. The Special Rapporteur highlights the\nbroadening of neo-Nazi groups to embrace white nationalists and right-wing populist\nmovements, and the manner in which this broadening poses a serious threat to many racial,\nethnic and religious groups. Women, gender and sexually diverse populations, and persons\nwith disabilities are also targets. She documents the recent political impact and popularity\nof neo-Nazism and its embrace even by political leaders at the highest levels of national\noffice. She also surveys the role of technology in consolidating neo-Nazism and its harmful\neffects, especially where children and youth are concerned. In conclusion, the Special\nRapporteur offers recommendations for future research and consultations in order for States\nto better understand and address the contemporary scourge of neo-Nazism.

Unfortunately, the\ninternational political agenda, which is focused on the prevention of irregular migration,\nand the populist and xenophobic anti-migration movements in certain countries and\nregions, are further encouraging a response to management of migration flows from a crime\nprevention perspective, which does not place human rights protection at the centre.\nIn mixed migration movements, people are placed into different categories and\nallocated different types of assistance accordingly. However, in practice it is challenging to\ndraw clear lines on the circumstances of each migratory journey, and identification through\nrigid categories could lead to gaps in protection and assistance to victims.\nIn the present report, the Special Rapporteur analyses challenges in the\nidentification, referral and protection of victims and potential victims of trafficking in\npersons in the context of mixed migration. Based on the findings and feedback of numerous\norganizations, she offers recommendations to help States, international organizations and\ncivil society organizations adapt their responses to ensure the effective protection of victims\nand potential victims of trafficking. These responses must be focused on the identification\nof groups and persons who by their characteristics and circumstances are in a vulnerable\nsituation, regardless of the specific determination of their case. Activating protection\nprotocols at the outset of identification of vulnerabilities may be one of the most effective\nways to assist victims of trafficking and avoid the re-victimization, detention and\ndeportation of victims and potential victims of trafficking in persons.\n\nGE.18-07730(E)\n\n\n\n",

Such acts are committed in\nall corners of the world, and victims are presumed to be in the millions, every year. These\nacts extend from daily exclusion and discrimination to the most heinous acts, including\ntorture and arbitrary killings. At their root lie the intent to punish the non-conformity of\nvictims with preconceived notions of what should be their sexual orientation or gender\nidentity. The Independent Expert highlights how lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender\nnon-conforming persons are affected differently by these acts and how intersecting factors\nhave an impact on their vulnerability and on their risk of exclusion and marginalization. He\nalso examines the link between hate speech and hate crimes, and the role of the media in\namplifying and disseminating messages that reinforce stigma and foster violence and\ndiscrimination.\nThe Independent Expert also explores the root causes of violence and discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity, including deeply entrenched stigma and\nprejudice reinforced by discriminatory laws and regulations that foster a climate where hate\nspeech, violence and discrimination are condoned and perpetrated with impunity. He\nexamines the impact of social prejudice and criminalization on the marginalization and\nexclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans and gender non-conforming persons, and\naddresses the issue of the negation of violence and discrimination based on sexual\norientation or gender identity and the resulting data gap, highlighting positive examples of\ndata-gathering and recent measures taken by States to address violence and discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity, including steps to acknowledge\nresponsibility as an essential element in the establishment of historical truth, the process of\nreparation and the reconstitution of the social fabric.\n\nGE.18-07487(E)\n\n\n\n",

Judicial councils play an essential role in guaranteeing\nthe independence and the autonomy of the judiciary. The underlying rationale for their\ncreation is the need to insulate the judiciary and judicial career processes from external\npolitical pressure. In addition to their primary function of safeguarding judicial\nindependence, a growing number of judicial councils have been entrusted with far-reaching\npowers in the area of promoting the efficiency and quality of justice, and of rationalizing\nthe administration of justice, court management and budgeting.\nIn the report, the Special Rapporteur shows that there is no one-size-fits-all model of\njudicial council. Each judicial governing body originates from a legal system with distinct\nhistorical, cultural and social roots; the specific role of each body varies from one country\nto the other. The Special Rapporteur shows that the number of judicial councils has\nincreased greatly in recent decades, and estimates that, to date, over 70 per cent of the\ncountries in the world have some form of judicial council. This is an area lacking in\nstatistical data at the global level, making it challenging to assess global trends.\nThe Special Rapporteur also shows that, despite the increase in the number of\njudicial councils in all regions of the world, there is a lack of international legal standards at\nthe international level specifically devoted to the role, composition and functions of judicial\ncouncils. The Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary do not include any\nprovision specifically devoted to judicial councils. The most comprehensive efforts to\ndevelop minimum standards relating to the creation, membership and role of judicial\ncouncils have been undertaken in Europe, under the aegis of the Council of Europe.\nIn the light of the existing international and regional standards, and based on the\ncontributions received from States and non-State actors, the Special Rapporteur offers some\nrecommendations relating to the establishment, composition and functions of judicial\ncouncils. These recommendations do not purport to identify an “ideal model” of national\njudicial council, but rather seek to define common principles, general trends and good\npractices for ensuring the independence of such bodies, where they exist, and their\neffectiveness in the discharge of their functions as guarantors of judicial independence.\nGE.18-06986(E)\n\n\n\n",

In the\nreport, the Special Rapporteur addresses the relationship between the right to health and\nspecific forms of deprivation of liberty and confinement in penal and medical regimes.\nDetention and confinement remain the policy tool preferred by States to promote public\nsafety, “morals” and public health, doing more harm than good to public health and the\nrealization of the right to physical and mental health. The Special Rapporteur calls for the\nfull implementation of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of\nPrisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and for the development of supportive communitybased services as alternatives to detention and confinement in various cases.\n\nGE.18-05613(E)\n\n\n\n",

The\nincreased social interactions, mutual understanding and trust that can be built or rebuilt\nthrough these initiatives are essential to achieve a range of human rights goals and to\nrespect cultural diversity.\nThe Special Rapporteur considers how cultural rights, and other human rights, are\nexercised through and affected by these actions in the cultural field; the specific challenges\nartists and cultural workers face when engaging in initiatives that question the\nrepresentation of society and seek to address its contemporary challenges of discrimination,\nexclusion and violence; the specific contribution these initiatives make to society; and the\nresponsibilities of State and non-State actors in creating and maintaining the conditions for\nactions in the field of culture that contribute to achieving societies more respectful of\nhuman rights.\n\nGE.17-23493(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report explains the difference between a housing\nstrategy and housing policy. It outlines the value of a human rights-based approach to\nhousing strategies and describes the key principles upon which effective rights-based\nhousing strategies must be based. While there is no “one size fits all” housing strategy, the\nSpecial Rapporteur identifies the most important requirements of each principle that should\nbe shaped to fit specific national and local contexts. These draw both on human rights\nnorms — as articulated by United Nations treaty bodies, courts and human rights\ninstitutions — and on the practical experiences of the Special Rapporteur, various levels of\ngovernment, civil society, experts and other actors. The report also provides examples of\nhow these key principles have been implemented in practice, in diverse national or local\ncontexts. The report concludes with a checklist to facilitate the design, monitoring,\nfinancing and implementation of human rights-based housing strategies.\n\nGE.18-00608(E)\n\n\n\n",

Some\nmigrants will need specific protection because of the situations they left behind, the\ncircumstances in which they travel or the conditions they face on arrival, or because of\npersonal characteristics such as their age, gender identity, disability or health status. The\nprinciples and guidelines, contained in an addendum to the present report, focus on the\nhuman rights situation of those migrants who may not qualify as refugees under the\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees, yet who are in vulnerable situations and thus\nin need of, and entitled to, the protection of the international human rights framework.\nThe principles are drawn directly from international human rights law and related\ninternational standards. The guidelines that follow each principle elaborate international\nbest practice and are designed to assist States (and other stakeholders where relevant) to\ndevelop, strengthen, implement and monitor measures to protect and promote the human\nrights of migrants in vulnerable situations. They are derived from the instruments\nthemselves and from authoritative interpretations or recommendations by international\nhuman rights treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights\nCouncil, as well as other expert sources.\n\nGE.17-23491(E)\n\n\n\n",

He notes that, to the extent that they are implemented\nconsistently with international law, including human rights norms and standards, the\nSustainable Development Goals and targets are a useful framework for supporting States in\nrespecting, protecting and fulfilling the right to work.\nAdopting a human rights-based approach to the implementation of the targets of the\nSustainable Development Goals insofar as it relates to vulnerable and marginalized\nindividuals, groups and populations is a fundamental element of contributing to the realization\nof the right to work. Consequently, how the right to work might be protected for a selection of\nthese groups (who tend to be overrepresented in the unemployment and informal work\nstatistics) as part of meeting these targets and fulfilling the commitments to leave no one\nbehind and to reach the furthest behind first is also discussed.\n\nGE.17-23490(E)\n\n\n\n",

The present report\ncovers the activities carried out between January and December 2017.\nIn the year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Rights of\nPersons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, patterns of\ndiscrimination and incitement to racial or religious hatred and violence, particularly against\nethnic or religious minorities have been recurrent. The strategies and initiatives undertaken\nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in line with the\nguidance note of the Secretary-General on racial discrimination and protection of\nminorities, aim to promote the implementation of the Declaration, with a view to advancing\nthe realization of the rights of persons belonging to minorities. In that regard, respect for\nreligious diversity and religious dialogue, reflection on the importance of investing in\nminority youth, disaggregated data on minorities and the participation of minorities in\ndecision-making are essential for fostering peaceful societies and reducing inequalities.\n\nGE.17-22922(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report\ncovers the period from July 2016 to June 2017 and describes the overall evolution of the\nhuman rights situation in the Central African Republic and the major developments\naffecting it.\nThe period was marked by an increase in the number of human rights violations and\nabuses, linked to the upsurge in fighting and to attacks by the various armed groups since\nSeptember 2016. Most of the abuses were committed during clashes between groups or\ntargeted attacks against civilians or in connection with movements by armed groups and\nwere the work of the ex-Séléka coalition led by the Front populaire pour la renaissance de\nla Centrafrique, as well as of the Union pour la paix en Centrafrique, the 3R group and antiBalaka groups acting alone or on behalf of the armed coalition. There are reports that, in\ncertain cases, ethnic or religious communities were targeted because of their perceived\naffiliation with an armed group. Thousands of children have been re-recruited into armed\ngroups after two years of efforts to reintegrate them into their communities of origin.\nPeace and reconciliation initiatives are essential but have so far failed to keep the\nguns at bay. Partners, neighbouring countries and friends of the Central African Republic\nmust work to bring about a peace process that is transparent, inclusive and respectful of\nnational sovereignty. Above all, peace efforts should never be promoted at the expense of\njustice for victims, given that impunity is one of the structural causes of violence in the\ncountry. The progressive establishment of the Special Criminal Court sends a strong signal\nin this regard.\nThe humanitarian situation has deteriorated as a result of the upsurge in violence,\ngiving rise to an increased number of displaced persons in the interior of the country and in\nBangui, notably in the PK5 neighbourhood. Nearly half the Central African population is in\na situation of need.\n\nGE.17-12914 (E)\n\n220817 230817\n\n\n\n",

Functioning of the Working Group\n2.\nThe Working Group was established by the Commission on Human Rights in its\nresolution 1991/42. The initial mandate of the Working Group was renewed by the\nCommission and the Human Rights Council. The Council assumed the mandate of the\nCommission in its decision 1/102, and it renewed the Working Group’s mandate in its\nresolutions 6/4, 15/18, 24/7 and 33/30. The Working Group’s mandate is considered for\nrenewal every three years.\n3.\n\nThe Working Group is organized internally as follows:\n\n(a)\nThe Working Group shall elect, at its spring session, a Chair-Rapporteur and\ntwo Vice-Chairs for a term of one year, taking due account of the need for rotation among\nthe geographical regions and the gender balance, among other considerations.

It also\ntransmitted 74 urgent appeals to 38 Governments concerning 263 individuals, and 19 letters\nof allegations and other letters to 17 Governments. States informed the Working Group that\nthey had taken measures to remedy the situations of detainees, and in an increasing number\nof cases the detainees were released. The Working Group is grateful to those Governments\nthat responded to its appeals and took steps to provide it with the information requested on\nthe situation of detainees.\nThe Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it visited, in\nparticular in connection to its recommendations. In 2016, the Working Group undertook\ntwo country visits, to Azerbaijan and the United States of America. The reports on those\nvisits are contained in addenda to the present report (A/HRC/36/37/Add.1 and Add.2,\nrespectively).\nIn the present report, the Working Group examines the issue of deprivation of liberty\non discriminatory grounds. It also analyses issues relating to the increasing number of new\nregimes of deprivation of liberty that arise in different situations and contexts around the\nworld.\nIn its recommendations, the Working Group calls for increased cooperation from\nStates, especially for country visits, for response to urgent appeals and communications,\nand for the enforcement of its opinions, with a view to preventing and ending arbitrary\ndetention. Furthermore, it calls upon the States concerned to take appropriate measures to\nprevent acts of reprisals against individuals who were the subject of an urgent appeal or\nopinion or who gave effect to a recommendation of the Working Group.\n\nGE.17-12131(E)\n\n\n\n",

The purpose of the report is to describe the most\nimportant advances in transitional justice, assess the current challenges facing its\nimplementation and make recommendations to meet those challenges.\nIn the first part, the Special Rapporteur describes the evolution of the field over the\nlast thirty years, highlighting distinctive regional approaches and debates. In the second, he\naddresses the many advances in the field, primary among them the unpacking of the\nconcept of justice into its set of constituent elements as well as placing victims at the centre\nof discussions and integrating a gender lens. He highlights innovations that the field has\nmade to the achievement of rights, including mitigating the effects of amnesties, the design\nof prosecutorial strategies to address system crimes, the use of truth commissions,\ncomprehensive reparations programmes capable of providing complex benefits to large\nuniverses of victims, and institutional, security sector and cultural reform initiatives.

Introduction\n1.\nIn its resolution 29/5, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee\nto undertake a study to review the implementation of the principles and guidelines for the\nelimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members,\ntogether with the obstacles thereto, and to submit a report to it at its thirty-fifth session\ncontaining practical suggestions for the wider dissemination and more effective\nimplementation of the principles and guidelines in order to eliminate discrimination and\nstigma associated with leprosy and to promote, protect and respect the human rights of\nthose affected by leprosy and their family members. The Council encouraged the Advisory\nCommittee, when elaborating the report, to take into account the views of Member States,\nas appropriate, relevant international and regional organizations, including the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights (OHCHR), relevant special procedures, national human rights institutions\nand non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as the work done on the issue by\nrelevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, funds and programmes within their\nrespective mandates.\n2.\nThroughout history, leprosy has been one of the most feared and misunderstood\ndiseases. One of the major reasons for the stigma and discrimination directed against\npersons affected by leprosy and their family members is the deep-rooted misconception,\nboth in the past and today, of leprosy, despite it being one of the least contagious human\ntransmissible diseases. In the past, the lack of scientific knowledge of the causative\norganism of the disease, its mode of transmission and lack of effective remedy contributed\nto the stigma and discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family\nmembers. Many countries pursued policies that isolated persons affected by leprosy, such\nas quarantine, forced hospitalization and the establishment of leprosariums, which were\nmaintained even when it was scientifically and medically proven that the disease was\ncompletely curable and not easily transmissible, thereby reinforcing stigma and\n\nGE.17-07193(E)\n\n\n\n",

The\nphenomenon of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity\nis both local and global, requiring strong national and international countermeasures to\npromote respect for sexual and gender diversity under the umbrella of international human\nrights law. In recognizing that everyone has some form of sexual orientation and gender\nidentity, there is the regrettable reality that some groups and persons are affected by\nviolence and discrimination, precisely because they are viewed as having a sexual\norientation and gender identity that is different from a particular societal norm.\nThe report offers a window through which to gauge the approach and methodology\nof the Independent Expert. There are key reflections responding to the mandate, particularly\nregarding the panorama of the situation, including the implementation of international\ninstruments, with identification of good practices and gaps; awareness of the violence and\ndiscrimination issue, and linkage with root causes; dialogue, consultation and cooperation\nwith States and other stakeholders; the identification of multiple, intersecting and\naggravated forms of violence and discrimination; and support for international cooperation\nand related services to assist national efforts.\nVarious underpinnings are singled out for specific attention to help prevent and\novercome negative elements fuelling violence and discrimination, and these will be dealt\nwith in greater detail in future reports: namely, decriminalization of consensual same-sex\nrelations; effective anti-discrimination measures; legal recognition of gender identity;\ndestigmatization linked with depathologization; sociocultural inclusion; and promotion of\neducation and empathy.\nThe report is anchored on the belief that while the diversity among human beings on\nthe basis of sexual orientation and gender identity should be recognized (“diversity in\nhumanity”), it is essential to harness and reinforce, from a young age, mutual respect,\ntolerance and understanding, compliance with human rights, and a sense of humanity and\ninclusivity inherent in that diversity (“humanity in diversity”), to accord protection for all\nand to all.\nGE.17-06261(E)\n\n\n\n",

In the report, the Working Group\nproposes an analysis on good practices for the elimination of discrimination against women\nin law and in practice and for women’s empowerment. The question of how to identify\ngood practices in ending discrimination against women is particularly poignant at this\nhistorical juncture, where a profound backlash against hard-won progress is occurring in all\nspheres. The continuing rise of fundamentalisms of all kinds and openly misogynistic,\nracist, xenophobic and populist voices, including Governments, is of grave concern to the\nGroup. Efforts to re-entrench patriarchal understandings of sex, gender and family into the\nlaw point to important questions about sustaining progress and ensuring that good practices\ncontinue to be possible in fraught contexts. Ongoing attacks on autonomous women’s\nmovements, civil society organizations, independent academia, public interest lawyers and\nwomen’s human rights defenders by State and non-State actors alike underscore the\nimportance of identifying those good practices that uphold human rights gains.\n\nGE.17-06247(E)\n\n\n\n",

The Special Rapporteur notes that the fundamental\nvalues of the international human rights system are under attack in new and diverse ways in\n2017. One widely shared explanation is the rapidly growing sense of economic insecurity\nafflicting large segments of many societies.\nThe Special Rapporteur suggests that the human rights community has had little to\noffer in response. Indeed, there is a risk that rather than seeking creative ways in which to\naddress the problem of economic insecurity the human rights system will proceed in\nzombie mode. It will keep marching straight ahead on the path mapped out long ago, even\nas the lifeblood drains out of the enterprise.\nThe report is premised on the view that the human rights movement needs to address\nand respond to the fundamental changes that are taking place in economic and social\nstructures at the national and global levels. In this setting, one of the most vibrant proposals\nis to replace or supplement existing social protection systems with a universal basic income\n(“basic income”). This proposal has recently drawn attention from governments, scholars,\nand practitioners in various fields. In its comprehensive and ideal form, a basic income is\nexplicitly designed to challenge most of the key assumptions underpinning existing social\nsecurity systems. Rather than payments being partial, they guarantee a floor; instead of\nbeing episodic, payments are regular; rather than being needs-based, they are paid as a flat\nrate to all; they come in cash, rather than as messy in-kind support; they accrue to every\nindividual, rather than only to needy households; rather than requiring that various\nconditions be met, they are unconditional; rather than excluding the well off, they are\nuniversal; and instead of being based on lifetime contributions, they are funded primarily\nfrom taxation. And simplicity of design promises minimal bureaucracy and low\nadministrative costs.\nThe principal purpose of the report is to reflect on the desirability of advocating a\nbasic income approach to social protection when viewed from the perspective of\ninternational human rights law. Basic income offers a bold and imaginative solution to\npressing problems that are about to become far more intractable as a result of the directions\nGE.17-04619(E)\n\n\n\n",

He also\nemphasizes the urgent need to ensure a stable government and provide redress to the\nvictims of cholera.\nThe Independent Expert visited the prisons of Croix-des-Bouquets and Cabaret. He\nreiterates the urgent need to put an end to prolonged pretrial detention. He also visited a\ncamp of returnees from the Dominican Republic. Their situation is very precarious and they\nare at risk of becoming stateless.\nThe Independent Expert travelled to Grand’Anse Department, where he visited a\nshelter in Jérémie and witnessed the plight of those affected by the hurricane.

It examines structural changes that have occurred in recent years whereby massive\namounts of global capital have been invested in housing as a commodity, as security for\nfinancial instruments that are traded on global markets, and as a means of accumulating\nwealth. The report assesses the effect of those historic changes on the enjoyment of the\nright to adequate housing and outlines an appropriate human rights framework for States to\naddress them. The report reviews the role of domestic and international law in that sphere,\nand considers the application of principles of business and human rights.\nThe report concludes with a review of States’ policy responses to the\nfinancialization of housing and some recommendations for more coherent and effective\nstrategies to ensure that the actions of global financial institutions and actors are consistent\nwith ensuring access to housing for all by 2030. The Special Rapporteur suggests that, as a\nway forward, States must redefine their relationship with private investors and international\nfinancial institutions, and reform the governance of financial markets so that, rather than\ntreating housing as a commodity valued primarily as an asset for the accumulation of\nwealth they reclaim housing as a social good, and thus ensure the human right to a place to\nlive in security and dignity.\n\nGE.17-00770(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report focuses on labour rights in the context of economic reform and\nausterity measures.\nIn many countries, austerity-related labour law reforms have been promoted by\ninternational financial institutions on the assumption that they will lead to economic growth\nand thus prevent or help overcome debt crises. These reforms have included freezing or\nreducing wages and minimum wages, extending working hours, placing workers on\nprecarious contracts or labour reserve schemes and facilitating dismissals. Of particular\nconcern are reforms that have targeted collective bargaining systems, for example by\nrestricting the extension of sector agreements and pushing bargaining down to the\nworkplace level or permitting bargaining with non-union representatives. In his report, the\nIndependent Expert argues that these reforms often erode labour rights and result in\nretrogression of work-related gender equality. They have frequently contributed to an\nincrease in inequality and insecure and informal employment; fostered discrimination in the\nlabour market towards young and older persons and individuals belonging to marginalized\nsocial groups; and resulted in the reduction of job-related social protection. Furthermore, it\nis questionable whether eroding labour rights generates economic and social benefits to\nother rights holders that would justify encroaching on them. The Independent Expert\nconcludes with a number of recommendations on how to improve the protection of\nindividual and collective labour rights in response to financial crises.\nGE.16-22938(E)\n\n\n\n",

Throughout the visit, the\nWorking Group enjoyed the fullest cooperation of the Government. It had the honour to be\nreceived by the President of the Republic and by some of the highest authorities of the\nState. The Working Group was able to hold confidential interviews with prisoners and\ndetainees at the Corradino Correctional Facility, the main prison of the country; the Young\nOffenders Unit Rehabilitation Services; the Safi detention centre in Safi Barracks; the Hal\nFar open centre; the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital; and the newly established\ninitial reception centre for children.\nIn the present report, the Working Group notes that the judicial system of Malta\ncontinues to be affected by lengthy delays in the administration of justice, as well as\ndiminished access by individuals to due process. The Working Group notes with\nsatisfaction that, according to recent amendments to the Criminal Code, persons deprived of\ntheir liberty now have the right to access to a lawyer immediately after their arrest and\nduring the first 48 hours of their detention, although this right does not apply to police\ninterrogation. Another positive development relates to the age of criminal responsibility,\nwhich has been raised from 9 to 14. However, juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age,\nwho are children according the Convention on the Rights of the Child (to which Malta is a\nState party), continue to be sent to General Courts for adults, instead of the Juvenile Court.\nThe Working Group takes note of the fact that, in 2012, a restorative justice act\nentered into force. It established a new parole system, which has already allowed\n38 persons to be released. However, this system still requires the financial resources\nnecessary to become fully operational, as well as improvements so that foreigners are able\n__________________\n\n* The present document was submitted late so as to include the most up-to-date information possible.\nGE.16-17374(E)\n\n\n\n",

At the end of June 2016, the situation was still worsening.\nThe Independent Expert underscores the importance of giving priority to ensuring\nthe protection of civilians and immediately carrying out the reforms of the security sector\nthat will make it possible to reassure civilians and to launch the other sectoral plans of\naction.\nThe Independent Expert encourages the authorities to ensure that the road map and\nshort- and medium-term sectoral plans are operational, with coordinated support from their\ninternational partners.

In the report, the Special Rapporteur focuses\non gender equality in the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation.\nGender equality is a fundamental human rights principle, yet inequalities between\nmen and women, and on the basis of gender identity, are observed in all countries and often\ntranslate into unequal opportunities and grave human rights violations. The Special\nRapporteur explains that a transformative approach is a prerequisite for ultimately\nachieving gender equality in the enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation.\nThis approach requires challenging social norms, stereotypes and intra-household patterns,\nwhile also promoting gender-responsive interventions that prioritize the implementation of\nwomen’s specific needs. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur indicates that tackling\nthe material and structural determinants of gender inequalities in access to water, sanitation\nand hygiene could serve as an entry point to address gender inequality more broadly.\nThe Special Rapporteur seeks to highlight areas that need particular attention in\norder to prevent and respond to gender inequalities in access to water and sanitation, as well\nas gender-based violence and barriers to the realization of the human rights to water and\nsanitation.\n\nGE.16-13009(E)\n\n\n\n",

The deadly impact of an untested consumer product on\npregnant women and children laid bare the magnitude to which industries fail to conduct\nreasonable amounts of due diligence, and the failure of States to require basic information\non health and safety. Poisonings around the world by pesticides, extractive industries and\nindustrial emissions to air and water — and their crippling impacts on the health,\ndevelopment and life of children — reinforce the need for strong measures to protect those\nmost at risk.\nHowever, the problem is not limited to poisoning. Childhood exposure is a systemic\nproblem everywhere. All around the world, children are born with dozens, perhaps\nhundreds, of hazardous substances in their bodies. This is leading to what doctors are\nreferring to as a “silent pandemic” of disease and disability affecting millions during\nchildhood and later in life. For a number of reasons, children are left without access to an\neffective remedy or justice for the harms of toxics and pollution, which enables perpetrators\nto remain unaccountable. Prevention of exposure is the best remedy. The best interests of\nthe child must be a primary consideration of States in protecting children’s rights to life,\nsurvival and development, physical integrity, health, being free from the worst forms of\nchild labour, and also to safe food, water and housing, and other rights implicated by toxics\nand pollution that are enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. States have a\nhuman rights obligation and businesses a corresponding responsibility to prevent childhood\nexposure to toxic chemicals and pollution.\n\nGE.16-13319(E)\n\n\n\n",

The independent experts who carried out the investigation\nhave found that gross human rights violations have been committed, primarily by State\nagents and those linked to them. They have also found that these gross violations are\nsystematic and patterned and that impunity is pervasive. While the crisis continues and\neven though the level of overt violence has declined, the overall level of oppression and\ncontrol over society has increased, as manifested by arbitrary deprivations of life, enforced\ndisappearances coupled with credible allegations of individuals being held in\nunacknowledged places of detention, cases of torture and other forms of ill-treatment and\narbitrary detention on a massive scale. Burundians are almost completely unable to enjoy\ntheir freedoms of expression, association and assembly. Victims and witnesses are the\ntargets of reprisals. Without a determined intervention by the Government of Burundi and a\nrenewed robust engagement by the international community, including the United Nations\nand the African Union, the country’s downward spiral is unlikely to be reversed,\nendangering not only the rights of individuals but also the overall security of the region.\nThe independent experts cannot exclude that some instances of gross human rights\nviolations may amount to crimes against humanity and call for the establishment of\nindependent international judicial processes to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect recent developments.\nGE.16-18543(E)\n\n\n\n",

It highlights the remarkable progress that\nthe country has achieved in the economic and political spheres and in terms of security.\nThe visit of the Independent Expert occurred a few weeks after the adoption of\nSecurity Council resolutions 2283 (2016) and 2284 (2016) on the situation in Côte d’Ivoire.\nBy the first of those resolutions, the Security Council decided to lift the arms embargo and\nto end the sanctions regime; by the second, it decided to extend the mandate of the United\nNations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) for a final period ending on 30 June 2017.\nThe Independent Expert urges Côte d’Ivoire to take full ownership of human rights\nprotection operations so as to be ready to take over when UNOCI withdraws from the\ncountry one year from now. In that regard, it is essential that the authorities revamp the\nNational Human Rights Commission of Côte d’Ivoire and provide it with the necessary\nmeans to carry out its mandate and to work independently.\nThe Independent Expert welcomes the establishment in January 2016 of two new\nministries whose work relates to the promotion of human rights: the Ministry of Solidarity,\nSocial Cohesion and Victim Compensation and the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil\nLiberties.

The Special Rapporteur proposes that xenophobia can be said to exist when\nindividuals are denied equal rights on account of the real or perceived geographic origins of\nthe said individuals or groups, or the values, beliefs and/or practices associated with such\nindividuals or groups that make them appear as foreigners or “outsiders”. This may be\nexplicit and obvious, such as discrimination against recent migrants or refugees. It may also\nbe less directly tied to a recent migration history and may target members of different\ncommunities who have lived alongside each other for generations.\nThe Special Rapporteur lays down key elements that need to be taken into\nconsideration in order to enhance the effectiveness of policies and measures to combat\nxenophobia.\n\nGE.16-07832(E)\n\n\n\n",

In the report,\nthe Working Group examines the duty of States to protect against human rights abuses\ninvolving those business enterprises that they own or control, which are generally referred\nto as State-owned enterprises. Many States the world over manage large State-owned\nenterprise portfolios and those enterprises have emerged as significant actors in the global\neconomy. State-owned enterprises can have important human rights impacts, both positive\nand negative. Yet, not enough attention has been paid to their human rights responsibilities\nand impacts, nor to the duties of States in this regard.\nThe report calls attention to and clarifies what States are expected to do in their role\nas owners of enterprises and why. The starting point is principle 4 of the Guiding Principles\non Business and Human Rights, which provides that States should take “additional” steps to\nprotect against human rights abuses by business enterprises that are owned or controlled by\nthe State. The report highlights the persuasive reasons for additional action to be taken by\nStates in this regard, including policy coherence, legal obligations, reputation and\ncredibility.\nThe Guiding Principles do not specify what steps States should take. In the present\nreport, the Working Group suggests a range of measures that States could take to\noperationalize the call to take additional steps with regard to State-owned enterprises, by\nbuilding on existing international guidance and national practices related to the corporate\ngovernance of those enterprises.\nIn working to ensure that all business enterprises respect human rights, there are\ncompelling reasons for States to lead by example and to do their utmost to ensure that the\nenterprises under their ownership or control fully respect human rights. The Working\nGroup calls on States to demonstrate that leadership.\nGE.16-07306(E)\n\n\n\n",

She notes that there is a lack of full acceptance and incorporation of the\ninternational norms and regional human rights standards on violence against women, and\nbelieves that specific measures are needed to address this normative challenge and the\nimplementation gap. The Special Rapporteur intends to examine the legal and policy\nframeworks of her mandate and international human rights mechanisms, focusing on the\ngap between incorporating and implementing international and regional standards relating\nto violence against women, the updating of general recommendation No. 19 of the\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the implementation\nframework of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. She will\nfurther focus on the links between violence against women before conflict, conflict and\npost-conflict situations and reparations for such violence, and the implementation of the\nSustainable Development Agenda, among others. She is interested in strengthening her\ncollaboration with international and regional human rights mechanisms and in joint work\non actions necessary to improve the acceptance, incorporation, implementation and\nupdating of the current framework in order to accelerate the elimination of all forms of\nviolence against women.\nThe Special Rapporteur subsequently sets out the thematic priorities of her intended\naction. In particular, her focus will be on the use of data on violence against women as a\ntool for its prevention.

The report is the first written by the Special Rapporteur\nsince she took up her duties on 1 August 2015. In the report, she recalls the origins of the\nmandate and the international and regional legal framework that has been studied, assessed\nand developed in the work of her three predecessors. She notes that, despite a\ncomprehensive international and regional legal framework which details the preconditions\nand prerequisites necessary in order to have an independent, competent and impartial\njudiciary and an independent and qualified legal profession, such independence and\nimpartiality are still extremely vulnerable, are under attack or are merely non-existent, in\nmany parts of the world.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Special Rapporteur explains that it is time to revisit the\nwell-established principles of judicial independence and impartiality, and the important\nbody of work, including the recommendations, left by her predecessors, with a view to\nhelping all stakeholders to take concrete measures to render the independence and\nimpartiality of the justice system more effective. To that end, she proposes to begin\nworking on a set of indicators of independence and impartiality which could be used by\nState institutions, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, civil society actors, donors and cooperation\nagencies, among others, to assess the independence and impartiality of specific justice\nsystems, to identify needs for reform, and to allow targeted measures and actions to be\ntaken to improve the administration of justice and the justice system in a more effective\nway.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes by recalling the centrality of the independence of\njudges and lawyers to the promotion and protection of human rights and mentions specific\nissues that she hopes to continue monitoring or to study in more detail during her tenure.\n\nGE.16-05469 (E)\n\n*1605469*\n\n",

In the report, the Special Rapporteur\nargues that treating economic and social rights as human rights is essential both for efforts\nto eliminate extreme poverty and to ensure a balanced and credible approach in the field of\nhuman rights as a whole. He argues that economic and social rights currently remain\nmarginal in most contexts, thus undermining the principle of the indivisibility of the two\nsets of rights.\nConventional wisdom celebrates the great strides that have been made in recent\nyears in relation to economic and social rights. At the international level, the Optional\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been\nadopted, an impressive number of special procedures have been created to focus on these\nrights and bodies like the Human Rights Council spend much more time than they once did\ndebating these issues. At the national level, economic and social rights proponents celebrate\nthe impressive degree of constitutional recognition of some or most economic and social\nrights, the growing capacity of courts in many countries to enforce them, the growth of\nnational non-governmental organizations working on economic and social rights and the\nemergence of a vibrant scholarly literature on the justiciability of those rights.\nHowever, despite important recent progress, the reality is that economic and social\nrights remain largely invisible in the law and institutions of the great majority of States. In\nsupport of this proposition, the Special Rapporteur notes that: many of the States whose\nConstitutions recognize economic and social rights have not translated that recognition into\na human rights-based legislative framework; the increasingly widespread constitutional\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent developments.\nGE.16-06981(E)\n\n\n\n",

These events which rekindled the power\nstruggle between the Government and rebel groups have had major political, security and\nhumanitarian repercussions in the country as well as serious consequences for the human\nrights situation there.\nArmed movements, including terrorist groups, are gradually regaining control of the\nnorth of the country and, for the first time, members of the United Nations\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) are being targeted\nby the jihadi groups. This extremely worrying situation is keeping humanitarian actors\naway from people living in northern Mali who are thus deprived of access to basic social\nservices.\nThe Independent Expert notes the contrast, since his last report, between the marked\ndecrease in cases of violations of the right to life attributable to the Malian armed forces\nand the significant increase in violations of human rights and of international humanitarian\nlaw by the different armed groups in northern Mali. The rape of minors by certain members\nof the Malian armed forces is the main source of concern.\nArmed and extremist groups present in the north of Mali continue to be involved in\nviolations of human rights: violations of the right to life, abductions, cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment, unlawful detention, the recruitment and use of children by armed\ngroups, asymmetrical attacks and looting.\n\nGE.15-00252 (E)\n\n050215 060215\n\n\n\n",

Following his second mission to the country, in\nJuly 2014, he reviews here the efforts made thus far to address the five human rights areas\nidentified in his previous report as warranting urgent action, namely: (a) illiteracy, (b)\nprolonged pretrial detention, (c) elections, (d) redress for large-scale human rights\nviolations perpetrated in the past and (e) resettlement of the people displaced by the 2010\nearthquake.\nFor each area, the Independent Expert identifies the problems observed and\nproposes specific solutions. As a prerequisite for addressing these urgent human rights\nmatters, however, there must be strong political will on the part of the Government and the\ninternational community, active involvement by civil society, consensus on the priority\nproblems to be addressed, focused coordination of work and perseverance in efforts to\nattain the stated goals.\nIn December 2014, a new Prime Minister was appointed as a first step towards\nclearing the impasse surrounding the holding of elections, which is one of the five areas\nidentified by the Independent Expert for priority action. Success on this front could bring\nsignificant momentum to the efforts to improve the human rights situation in Haiti. The\nearly days of 2015 will be decisive in this regard.\n\nGE.15-02042 (E)\n\n090315 100315\n\n\n\n",

Tax\nevasion and abuse are considered to be responsible for the majority of all illicit financial\noutflows, followed by illicit financial flows relating to criminal activities, such as drug and\nhuman trafficking, the illicit arms trade, terrorism and corruption-based illicit financial\nflows. According to some estimations developing countries lost US$ 991 billion in illicit\nfinancial outflows in 2012 and those flows increased in real terms at a rate of 9.4 per cent\nper annum over the period 2003–2012. The annual loss is substantially more than the\nestimated yearly costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe present interim study is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution\n25/9, and updates earlier reports by the previous Independent Expert. It outlines how illicit\nfinancial flows undermine the enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil and political\nrights and emphasizes the need for due diligence and due process in the fight against illicit\nfinancial flows, for better protection of witnesses and whistle-blowers and for incorporating\nhuman rights considerations in the management of returned stolen assets. It concludes with\nrecommendations on how the goal of curbing illicit financial flows could be\noperationalized within the post-2015 development agenda of the United Nations.\n\n* Late submission.\nGE.15-02121 (E)\n\n\n\n",

The cultural construction of gender determines the role of\nwomen and girls within the family, including in marriage. After analysing the impact of\nculture and religion on the enjoyment of equal rights by women and girls in society and the\nfamily, the Working Group redefines family by incorporating a gender perspective. In\nreaffirming equality between the sexes and family diversity, it is necessary to apply the\nprinciple of women’s right to equality in all forms of family law, in secular family law\nsystems, State-enforced religious family law systems and plural systems. After recalling the\nobligation of States to combat discrimination against women in cultural and family life, the\nWorking Group makes several recommendations, drawing on good practices, for the\nestablishment of true equality between the sexes in cultural and family life.\n\nGE.15-07003 (E)\n\n060515 080615\n\n\n\n",

It also provides a thematic analysis of the human rights of\ninternally displaced persons in the context of the post-2015 development agenda.\nThe objective of ensuring a life of dignity for all lies at the heart of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Internally displaced persons\nare frequently deprived of their human rights, stripped of the elements of their lives that\nprovide dignity: their homes, a livelihood and income, a sense of belonging and of what the\nfuture holds, security and justice, the knowledge that they will be able to feed, clothe and\neducate their children, and the ability to make decisions about their lives. The displacement\nexperience is one of trauma, dependency and survival, with the average conflict-induced\ndisplacement lasting a staggering 17 years. Ensuring durable solutions for internally\ndisplaced persons is a complex process which requires that they be included in sustainable\ndevelopment goals and strategies that seek to restore to them conditions of normality in\ncircumstances of dignity and safety, and a secure future.\n\nGE.15-06840 (E)\n\n\n\n",

The Special Rapporteur endeavoured to go beyond the\nmore limited notion of juvenile justice, so as to reflect the diverse experiences of children\nwhen they encounter the justice system as victims or witnesses, because they are in conflict\nwith the law, or as parties to judicial proceedings.\nFollowing a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in\n2014-2015, the thematic section of the report consists of five parts. The first sets the legal\nframework and fundamental principles upon which the Special Rapporteur’s analysis of the\nrequirements for a child-sensitive administration of justice is based. The second part\ndiscusses access to justice and legal aid from the perspective of children. The safeguards\nnecessary to respect, protect and fulfil children’s rights at the different stages of judicial\nproceedings, including sentencing, are addressed in the third part. The fourth part touches\non the importance of providing children with alternatives to judicial proceedings. In the last\npart, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the essential need for quality and specialized\neducation, training and capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and lawyers. Sections IV\nand V contain conclusions and a number of recommendations.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes that investing in child-sensitive justice is\nindispensable to strengthening the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights by all, as\nwell as to building flourishing democratic societies. In all the aspects of the justice system,\nchildren have special rights, needs and interests that must be given primary consideration.\n\nGE.15-06834 (E)\n\n\n\n",

It calls for ex ante and ex post human rights, health and environmental impact\nassessments, and proposes a plan of action for systemic change.\nBecause all States are bound by the Charter of the United Nations, all treaties must\nconform with it, in particular with Articles 1, 2, 55 and 56. While recognizing that\nglobalization may contribute to human rights and development, experience suggests that\nhuman rights have frequently been subordinated to dogmas of market fundamentalism with\na focus on profit rather than sustainable development. Article 103 of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations stipulates that “[i]n the event of conflict between the obligations of the\nMembers of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any\nother international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail”.\nAccordingly, international investment agreements and investor–State dispute settlement\nagreements must be tested for conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and never\nundermine the ontological State function to ensure the welfare of all persons under its\njurisdiction, nor lead to retrogression in human rights. Conflicting agreements or arbitral\nawards are incompatible with international ordre public, and may be considered contrary to\nprovisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and invalid as contra bonos\nmores.\n\n* The annex to the present report is circulated as received, in the language of submission only.\nGE.15-11570(E)\n\n*1511570*\n\n",

Offering conceptual\nclarity to the term “guarantees of non-recurrence”, the Special Rapporteur suggests\nstructuring such policies around three main spheres of intervention. At the level of official\nState institutions, the report begins with a reminder of some basic conditions, including\nsecurity and legal identity, and proceeds to offer a range of initiatives, including the\nratification of relevant treaties; justice and security sector reforms; changes in security\nlegislation; and constitutional reforms, incorporating the separation of powers principle,\nremoving discriminatory provisions and incorporating a bill of rights. The Special\nRapporteur then draws attention to two spheres of intervention, the potential of which has\nnot been frequently examined as part of guarantees of non-recurrence, namely, civil society\nand the spheres of culture and personal dispositions. In these sections, the Special\nRapporteur mentions the importance of legal empowerment and the creation of an enabling\nenvironment in order for civil society to discharge its crucial role. Finally, the Special\nRapporteur emphasizes the preventive potential of education reform, arts and culture, and\ntrauma counselling.\n\n*\n**\n\nLate submission.\nThe annex to the present report is circulated as received, in the language of submission only.\n\nGE.15-15026(E)\n\n*1515026*\n\n",

The Working Group\nis grateful to those Governments that heeded its appeals and that took steps to provide it\nwith the requested information on the situation of detainees.\nThe Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it visited, in\nparticular in respect of its recommendations. Information on the implementation of\nrecommendations made by the Working Group was received from the Government of\nEl Salvador. In 2014, the Working Group visited New Zealand and undertook follow-up\nvisits to Germany and Italy. The reports on these visits are contained in addenda to the\npresent report (A/HRC/30/36/Add.2, 4 and 3, respectively).\nPursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group is also\nsubmitting to the Council a report containing the draft basic principles and guidelines on\nremedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or\ndetention to bring proceedings before court (A/HRC/30/37), which were adopted by the\nWorking Group at its seventy-second session. The draft basic principles and guidelines are\naimed at assisting Member States in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation\nof liberty. The Working Group also prepared a report on national, regional and international\nlaws, regulations and practices on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before\ncourt (A/HRC/27/47).\n\nGE.15-11705(E)\n\n*1511705*\n\n",

The Working Group’s global study aims to assess existing\nnational laws regarding private military and security companies and their effectiveness in\nprotecting human rights and promoting accountability for violations. Furthermore, it aims\nto identify any commonalities, good practices and regulatory gaps that may exist.\nThe Working Group notes that, while there are common elements in the laws of\nthese countries, their regulatory approach to private military and security companies varies.\nThe Working Group reiterates the need to effectively regulate the activities of private\nmilitary and security companies and invites all Member States to facilitate its study, which\naims to guide them in exercising effective oversight of the activities of such companies.\n\nGE.15-11553 (E)\n\n\n\n",

He presents a view of the human rights situation in the\ncountry since his fourth visit, thus covering the period from 4 May to 30 December 2013,\nin the light of his previous recommendations.\nThis visit took place in a context marked by important developments, including the\nrelease of about 15 detainees associated with the former President, Laurent Gbagbo, a\npresidential amnesty for persons convicted of minor offences and the publication of laws on\nsensitive topics such as nationality and rural landownership. Such questions have been the\nsubject of numerous recommendations by the Independent Expert and other United Nations\nmechanisms.\nThe Independent Expert noted that the security situation in Côte d’Ivoire has\ncontinued to improve, but remains fragile. On the one hand, a culture of violence persists\nand a large number of former combatants have yet to benefit from the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration programme. On the other hand, in some regions, dozo\ngroups have continued to replace the State in its sovereign role of providing for security.\nThe Independent Expert noted with concern that despite the establishment of the\npermanent framework for dialogue, the political dialogue is still deadlocked. The most\nworrisome sign of this is the return to the partisan and polarizing verbal invective that\ncharacterized the pre- and post-election crisis. In the run-up to the 2015 presidential\nelections and with the kind of electioneering the country has seen, such trends could leave\nany progress made in the past two years in establishing democratic institutions devoid of\nany meaning. A moral resurgence on the part of the country’s political leaders is urgently\nneeded; they must take bold and meaningful political initiatives to resuscitate the political\ndialogue and establish the conditions required for peaceful and democratically credible\npresidential elections. The recent resumption of contacts between the Government and\nthe Front Populaire Ivoirien (Ivorian Popular Front) (FPI) should not aim merely to “cool\n\nGE.14-10154 (E)\n\n170214 180214\n\n*1410154*\n\n",

Covering the period from 1 July to 30 December 2013, it examines the political and\nsecurity situation as well as the institutional reforms undertaken by Mali since the end of\nthe severe crisis triggered in January 2012 by the occupation of the north of the country by\narmed groups and the return to constitutional order.\nThe independent expert also reports on human rights violations in the country,\nincluding summary executions, enforced disappearances, rapes, looting, arbitrary arrests\nand detentions, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment perpetrated by the\nMalian armed forces and armed groups in the country.\nDespite the complex causes of the conflict between the Government and the armed\ngroups of the north and the mistrust arising from a number of historical episodes of the\nconflict, the protagonists have demonstrated the political will to find lasting solutions to the\nmultidimensional crisis that has shaken Mali. The Malian stakeholders must persevere in\nseeking negotiated solutions to their internal problems of governance while urging their\nneighbours in the Sahel and in the Arab Maghreb as well as the international community to\ntake seriously the problems of transnational crime and terrorism that threaten to destabilize\nboth Mali and the States of the region.\nThe recent crisis has revealed the underlying causes that almost led to the collapse\nof the State: years of deteriorating public institutions, including those that govern the rule\nof law, which allowed corruption to become generalized and impunity to take root. In\naddition to judicial prosecution of the perpetrators of the most serious crimes and abuse\ncommitted in the course of the last crisis, consolidation of peace in Mali will require\nreforms of the justice and security sectors, efforts to combat the endemic corruption of civil\nservants brought about by international trafficking and the criminalization of the economy\nof the north, as well as other institutional reforms.\n\nGE.14-10118 (E)\n\n050214 060214\n\n*1410118*\n\n",

The independent expert carried out a mission to Haiti in\nSeptember 2013, to Port-au-Prince and Jacmel.\nOn the basis of his predecessors’ analyses of the situation, which he shares, the\nindependent expert has identified five main problems that contribute to the commission of\nhuman rights violations in Haiti and require urgent action:\nFirst, social inequality, as a result of which much of the population lacks resources\nand has no access to economic, social and cultural rights;\nSecondly, the plight of detainees, particularly the problem of prolonged pretrial\ndetention;\nThirdly, the weakness of the rule of law;\nFourthly, human rights violations committed in the past;\nAnd fifthly, the impact on human rights of the disasters that have hit Haiti. The\nindependent expert specifically addresses the situation of internally displaced persons\n(IDPs) in camps, mainly as a result of the 2010 earthquake, the cholera epidemic and the\nsituation of people of Haitian origin who could end up being stateless. The independent\nexpert hopes that the proposed shock treatment will help to put an end to violations that\npersist in these five areas, will send out a strong message showing commitment to\nremedying the situation and will pave the way for the implementation of recommendations\nmade in the last few decades, particularly in the context of the universal periodic review\nand special procedures of the Council, which the independent expert reiterates while\noffering his assistance for their implementation.\n\nGE.14-10841 (E)\n\n130314 140314\n\n*1410841*\n\n",

The Independent Expert includes a thematic discussion\non “Ensuring the inclusion of minority issues in post-2015 development agendas”. As\nmomentum builds towards the shaping of new global development goals, addressing\ninequalities has emerged as a core area of discussion and consultation. This gives greater\nattention to the issues of women, those with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable groups.\nHowever the Independent Expert considers that the issues of minorities remain relatively\npoorly reflected in the emerging discussions, both internationally and nationally. She urges\ngreater and systematic attention to disadvantaged minorities who constitute hundreds of\nmillions of the poorest and most socially and economically marginalized and excluded\npeople globally.\nThe Independent Expert identifies the need for the new global development agenda\nto include specific goals relating to addressing inequality and promoting social inclusion,\nwhich include specific requirements and targets focused on activities to address the\nsituations of disadvantaged minority groups. Human rights-based approaches to\ndevelopment are essential and must give greater attention to the promotion and protection\nof minority rights, which offers an important path to development for national, ethnic,\nreligious and linguistic minorities.\n\nGE.14-10072\n\n*1410072*\n\n",

The Independent Expert finds\nthat illicit financial flows, including those derived from corruption and embezzlement by\npublic officials, have considerable negative impacts on the realization of human rights,\nparticularly in developing countries and especially in a context where those countries face a\nfinancing gap of around US$ 112 billion annually to meet the Millennium Development\nGoals aimed at delivering basic social goods such as education, health care, water and\nsanitation and food security. By reducing the resources available to States to establish the\nconditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights through investment in\nsocial programmes, and to create and strengthen the institutions that uphold civil and\npolitical rights, illicit financial flows compromise the ability of the affected Governments\nto devote the maximum available resources to the realization of human rights. An\nadditional consequence of illicit funds is the further perpetration and promotion of criminal\nactivities, including terrorism, which endanger democracy and the realization of human\nrights.\n\n* Late submission.\nGE.14-02717\n\n*1402717*\n\n",

The\nSpecial Rapporteur stresses the significance of actions in the cultural field for achieving the\noverall societal goals of transitional justice, while noting that entire cultural and symbolic\nlandscapes are designed through memorials and museums, which both reflect and shape,\nnegatively or positively, social interactions and people’s cognition of identities – their own\nas well as that of others.\nAddressing some difficult challenges encountered in memorializing the past, the\nSpecial Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations grounded in the principle that\nmemorialization should be understood as a process that provides to those affected by\nhuman rights violations the spaces necessary to articulate their narratives. Memorial\npractices should stimulate and promote civic engagement, critical thinking and discussion\nregarding the representation of the past, but equally the contemporary challenges of\nexclusion and violence.\n*\n\nThe annex to the present report is circulated in the language of submission only.\n\nGE.14-10501\n\n*1410501*\n\n",

He presents an assessment of changes in the human rights\nsituation in the country since his previous report, which followed his fifth visit to the\ncountry from 14 to 23 October 2013 (A/HRC/25/73). The bulk of the report concerns a\nproposed programme of action for addressing the needs of the victims of the Ivorian crisis,\nwhich is the outcome of the international conference on the situation of victims of the\nIvorian crisis, organized in Abidjan from 12 to 14 February 2014 on the initiative of the\nIndependent Expert.\nThe Independent Expert draws attention to the fact that the situation in Côte d’Ivoire\nis at a crossroads and is becoming ever more complex with the approach of the 2015\npresidential elections. This complexity is compounded by a regional context that is still\nfragile on account of the emerging conflicts.\nIn the report, the Independent Expert re-examines a number of constant concerns\nconnected, inter alia, with the increase in sexual violence, the persistence of the abuses\ncommitted by the Forces républicaines de Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI) and the dozos, the\npopulation’s socioeconomic circumstances and with concerns about freedom of expression\nand association.

The roles and\nresponsibilities assigned to women and men on the basis of stereotypes relegate women to a\nsubordinate status and limit their economic opportunities. A significant number of countries\nhave adopted anti-discrimination measures, but these have not resulted in equality of\nopportunity in women’s economic and social lives. Women are disproportionately\nconcentrated in informal and precarious employment; they are exposed to multiple forms of\ndiscrimination; the wage gap persists; maternity protections have not been fully and\neffectively implemented; and in many countries women do not have equal rights and access\nto resources. There has been little attention the negative impacts of the business sector on\nwomen’s enjoyment of human rights. Care functions are disproportionately allocated to\nwomen and create a major barrier to women’s full participation in economic market\nactivity. Violence against women is another obstacle to women’s equal opportunity.\nAusterity measures taken by some States in response to economic crisis have had a\ndisparate impact on women, increasing the precarity of their employment and their burden\nof unpaid care work. The Working Group calls for the establishment of gender-responsive\nand effective accountability systems at the international, regional and national levels to\neliminate all forms of de facto discrimination against women.\n\nGE.14-12834\n\n*1412834*\n\n",

The main goal of the report is\nto demonstrate that judicial accountability and judicial independence are two essential\nelements of an independent, impartial and efficient justice system, and that, as a\nconsequence, States should undertake efforts to develop and adopt international standards\nfor judicial accountability to guide the enactment of domestic legislation establishing a\ncomprehensive system of judicial accountability which is effective, objective, transparent\nand respects judicial independence.\nFollowing a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in\n2013 and 2014, the thematic section of the report first considers concepts and definitions of\njudicial accountability, highlighting its importance for upholding the rule of law and\nstrengthening the independence of the judiciary. The report then examines existing\ninternational human rights standards relating to judicial accountability.

The Special Rapporteur highlights the urgent\nneed for States to address structural changes in the food environment, which negatively\nimpact individuals’ enjoyment of the right to adequate and nutritious food – an underlying\ndeterminant of the right to health. Global trade, increased foreign direct investment (FDI) in\nthe food sector and the pervasive marketing of unhealthy foods have increased the\nconsumption of unhealthy foods, which have been linked to diet-related NCDs.\nThe Special Rapporteur outlines a number of policies to increase the availability and\naccessibility of healthier food options, including through fiscal policies and the regulation\nof marketing and promotion of unhealthy foods, as well as increasing information and\nawareness about the health risks posed by unhealthy foods. He observes States’ obligations\nin ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of the right to health, and points to the\nresponsibilities of the food industry in refraining from producing, marketing and promoting\nunhealthy foods. He also stresses the need for various accountability and remedial\nmechanisms by which individuals can seek redress to violations of their right to health, and\nunderlines the importance of international assistance and cooperation in the prevention and\nreduction of the increasing burden of diet-related NCDs.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes his report with a set of recommendations, aimed\nGE.14-12776\n\n*1412776*\n\n",

Taxation is a key tool when tackling inequality and for\ngenerating the resources necessary for poverty reduction and the realization of human\nrights, and can also be used to foster stronger governance, accountability and participation\nin public affairs. She outlines relevant human rights obligations to guide and inform State\nrevenue-raising practices, including the duty to use the maximum available resources for\nthe realization of economic, social and cultural rights. She also analyses the questions of\nhow the principles of non-discrimination and equality and the duty of international\ncooperation and assistance should inform taxation policies at the global and national levels.\nAfter assessing how revenue-raising policies and practices can be strengthened through a\nhuman rights-based approach, she makes recommendations for fiscal and tax policies that\nare grounded in human rights and can lead to poverty reduction, sustainable development\nand the realization of transformative rights.\n\n*\n\nLate submission.\n\nGE.14-03374 (E)\n\n*1403374*\n\n",

The Special Rapporteur on the right to education\nunderlines the importance of developing and applying national assessment systems which\nare in compliance with international human right norms, so that education meets the\nessential objectives assigned to it in human rights conventions. He considers that such a\nhuman rights-based, holistic approach is essential for fostering the humanistic mission of\neducation rather than its mere instrumental role, using a narrow scope of assessments linked\nto mathematical literacy and language skills only. The report also places emphasis on skills\ndevelopment as an integral part of basic education and on the need for innovative\nassessment modalities of technical and vocational education and training, particularly in\ndeveloping countries, in response to the rising aspirations of youth, while not losing sight of\nthe human rights perspective.\nThe report concludes with recommendations to strengthen human rights-based,\nholistic approaches to national assessments of the educational attainments of students.\n\n*\n\nLate submission.\n\nGE.14-14089\n\n*1414089*\n\n",

Subedi\nSummary\nThe present report reflects on the work of the Special Rapporteur, Professor Surya\nSubedi, for the past six years in general and the past 12 months in particular. The Special\nRapporteur has had the privilege of serving as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of\nhuman rights in Cambodia since May 2009. It gives him pleasure to state that the situation\nin Cambodia has come full circle during the intervening six years and the country is\ncurrently in the process of peaceful political transition. These years have been stimulating,\nintellectually challenging and rewarding at the same time for the Special Rapporteur. He\nfinds it gratifying to report that some of his recommendations have been implemented and\nothers are in the process of being implemented by the Government.\nThe focus of the Special Rapporteur during the reporting period (1 July 2013–\n24 July 2014) has been on the possibility for the establishment of an independent national\nhuman rights institution that meets the benchmarks of the principles relating to the status of\nnational institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles)\nand on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his previous four\nsubstantive and substantial reports dealing with judicial, parliamentary, electoral and land\nreform in Cambodia. The Special Rapporteur focused his last two missions to the country\n— conducted in January and in June 2014 — on those two objectives and continued to\nmonitor the situation of human rights in Cambodia.\nThe Special Rapporteur was welcomed by the Government during his two missions\nto the country in January and June 2014. He was able to meet with senior members of the\nGovernment of Cambodia, including the Prime Minister, who assured him that many of his\nrecommendations were being implemented and that those specifically relating to judicial\nand electoral reform would be implemented in the near future. The Prime Minister was\nreceptive to the idea of establishing an independent national human rights institution that\nmeets the Paris Principles.\nCambodia witnessed major political events during the reporting period, including\nelections to the National Assembly in July 2013. The elections were conducted in a largely\npeaceful manner, but were marred by allegations of electoral irregularities. Calling for an\nGE.14-13379 (E)\n\n*1413379*\n\n",

The Working Group acknowledged the importance of the theme\nand noted that, despite guarantees in international and national law, racism, racial\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance affect people of African descent in a\nunique fashion, to the point that many of them are still unable to obtain remedies for\nwrongful acts through their domestic institutions. The Working Group urged States to\ndevelop a national atlas mapping injustices, on the basis of comprehensive disaggregated\ndata. It also urged States to adopt national action plans against racial discrimination, which\nshould include special measures and be based on disaggregated data, as appropriate, to\naddress structural discrimination against people of African descent, taking into account\ngeneral recommendation No. 32 (2009) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial\nDiscrimination on the meaning and scope of special measures in the International\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms Racial Discrimination. It also reiterated its\nrecommendation that practical activities should be developed at the national, regional and\ninternational levels during the International Decade for People of African Descent.\n\n* Annex II is reproduced as received, in the languages of submission only.\nGE.14-08309 (E)\n\n*1408309*\n\n",

The Special Rapporteur calls\nfor such strategies to tackle the systemic dimensions of violations so as to dismantle the\nweb of players and structures that enabled the atrocities to take place.\nHe stresses that criminal justice must not lead to instances of mere “turn-taking”.\nAs a major safeguard against that risk, he underscores the importance of the\nindependence of prosecutors, enabling them to address impartially the complex pattern\nof violations committed by all sides, which in turn allows for charges that are\nrepresentative of the actual violations.\nIn conclusion, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the growing importance of the\nparticipation of victims in judicial processes, including in relation to the design of\nprosecutorial strategies, and calls for in-depth studies on the institutionalization of\nparticipation mechanisms.\n\n*\n\nLate submission.\n\nGE.14-14898 (E)\n\n*1414898*\n\n",

The report is based\non a comprehensive understanding of the human rights violations which occur when States\nfail to meet any human rights obligation. All components of human rights are justiciable,\nand any violation must be subject to effective remedies.\nThe Special Rapporteur develops a typology of violations, examining breaches of\nthe obligations to respect, to protect, to fulfil, to refrain from discrimination, to ensure\nsubstantive equality and to ensure active, free and meaningful participation, as well as\nextraterritorial obligations.

In the report, the Special Rapporteur presents some preliminary reflections on\nthe status of operationalization of international standards relating to indigenous peoples and\nher vision for her work as Special Rapporteur in that context. There are a number of\naddenda to the present report, all reports by the previous Special Rapporteur.\nThe Special Rapporteur notes that there is a strong legal and policy foundation upon\nwhich to move forward with the implementation of indigenous peoples’ rights, and there\nhave been many advances, which the Special Rapporteur hopes to examine and document\nduring the course of her mandate. Nevertheless, many challenges continue to confront\nindigenous peoples throughout the world. In accordance with Human Rights Council\nresolution 15/14, a core aspect of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is to examine ways\nand means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full and effective protection of the rights\nof indigenous peoples. As an initial step, and given that the present report is her first to the\nHuman Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur identifies in broad strokes some of those\nobstacles, which are found to some extent in all countries in which indigenous peoples are\nliving.\nThe obstacles identified in section III of the report include (a) the failure or\nreluctance of governments to recognize indigenous peoples; (b) challenges in the\ndevelopment of practical implementation measures; (c) reconciliation and redress for\nhistorical wrongs yet to be completed; (d) ongoing negative attitudes towards indigenous\npeoples on the part of broader societies in which they live; and (e) social and economic\nconditions preventing the full exercise of indigenous peoples’ human rights. The list is\nneither comprehensive nor exhaustive, and the obstacles identified are in many ways\ninterrelated.

In the present report, the Working Group focuses on laws\nand regulations of eight francophone countries in Africa, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon,\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia as\nwell as those of eight countries in the Asia region, namely China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. The Working Group’s\nglobal study aims to assess existing national laws regarding PMSCs and their effectiveness\nin protecting human rights and promoting accountability for violations. Furthermore, it\naims at identifying common points, good practices and regulatory gaps that may exist.\nThe Working Group observes that, while there are common elements in the laws of\nthese countries, diverse contexts at the national level affect the way in which PMSCs are\nregulated and the regulatory approach of each country significantly varies. The Working\nGroup reiterates the need for effective regulation of the activities of PMSCs and invites all\nMember States to facilitate its study of national legislation, which aims to identify trends\nand good practices and to develop guidance for Member States in exercising effective\noversight of the activities of PMSCs.\n\nGE.14-06904 (E)\n\n*1406904*\n\n",

The Working Group is grateful to those Governments that heeded its\nappeals and took steps to provide it with the requested information on the situation of\ndetainees. The Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it\nvisited, particularly concerning its recommendations. Information regarding the\nimplementation of recommendations made by the Working Group was received from the\nGovernments of Georgia and Senegal.

He subsequently explores\nroot causes and relevant factors that underlie such violence. The main message is that\nviolence in the name of religion should not be misperceived as a “natural” outbreak of\ncollective acts of aggression that supposedly reflect sectarian hostilities existing since time\nimmemorial. Rather, it typically originates from contemporary factors and actors, including\npolitical circumstances.\nThe Special Rapporteur also recommends concerted actions by all relevant\nstakeholders, including States, religious communities, interreligious dialogue initiatives,\ncivil society organizations and media representatives, in order to contain and eventually\neliminate the scourge of violence committed in the name of religion.\n\nGE.14-25087 (E)\n\n\n\n",

The report focuses on the roles of local and other subnational\nlevels of government and considers how they can be fully engaged in the realization of the\nright to adequate housing. In the context of a trend toward decentralization of\nresponsibilities, the report finds that while decentralization may have significant\nadvantages, it must always be guided by human rights. Local and subnational governments\nshould be cognizant of and accountable to the human rights obligations that go along with\ntheir growing responsibilities and States must ensure that they have the capacity and\nresources needed to fulfil those obligations.\nWhile international human rights obligations extend to all levels of government,\ninternational human rights mechanisms tend to focus more on the role of national level\ngovernments. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of international human\nrights mechanisms engaging constructively with the responsibilities of local governments\nand finds that communications procedures and country missions provide positive\nopportunities in that regard.\nThe report finds that housing rights claims at the domestic level often address the\nrole of local and other subnational governments and have generated contextualized\nunderstandings of the right to adequate housing. Drawing inspiration from emerging human\nrights initiatives bringing together cities and subnational governments, civil society,\ncommunity-based organizations and human rights institutions, the report underscores the\nbenefit of interactive relationships with local struggles for the realization of the right to\nadequate housing.\nGE.14-24816 (E)\n\n\n\n",

It is intended to contribute to a better understanding of when financial support\nmay contribute to, or sustain the commission of, large-scale gross human rights violations\nby sketching a rational choice framework premised on the incentives of authoritarian Governments and private and official lenders. In the report, the Independent Expert on the\neffects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the\nfull enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights,\nreviews the existing empirical evidence of the relationship between sovereign financing,\nhuman rights practices and the consolidation of Governments engaged in gross violations\nof human rights.

The response of\nthe State security system to this wave of attacks has at times been disproportionate, leading\nto some recognized human rights violations.\nIt is against this background that the Independent Expert gathered information on\nthe increasingly precarious human rights situation, which would appear likely to undermine\ndemocratic, economic and social gains. With regard to the violations committed by\nassailants in the course of attempts to destabilize the country, some 60 people were killed,\nincluding Forces Républicaines de Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI) troops and civilians, women and\nchildren. In certain areas in the west of the country, populations were displaced by the\nattacks, fearing for their lives, and hundreds of people were forced to leave their villages to\ntake refuge in neighbouring areas.\nThe FRCI reacted vigorously to attacks by the assailants by strengthening its\npresence in Abidjan and other areas, particularly in sensitive areas such as the west of the\ncountry and the borders with Liberia and Ghana. FRCI troops set up roadblocks and\nconducted searches and raids in villages. Against this background, violations of the right to\nlife, arbitrary arrest and detention, acts of torture, violations of the right to property,\nextortion and racketeering were reported throughout the country, particularly in the west.\n\nGE.13-10074 (E)\n\n080213 080213\n\n",

He then analyses the\nstate of the prison system, the use of extended pretrial detention and the police service.\nHe also reviews the situation of children, particularly with regard to adoption, the\n“restavek” and victims of trafficking, in order to draw attention to the need for more\nstringent laws and for juvenile courts.\nThe independent expert then turns to the question of economic, social and cultural\nrights in Haiti, makes some specific recommendations about the rights to food, education\nand health care, and discusses the cholera issue and the situation in the camps.\nFinally, the independent expert proposes that a mechanism for the progressive\ntransfer of international protection functions to the Haitian authorities should be\nestablished based on action in four key areas: the appointment of an interministerial\ndelegate for the rule of law; the granting of stronger powers to the Office of the\nOmbudsperson (Office de la Protection du Citoyen) and to the Civil Defence Department\n(Direction de la Protection Civile); and the establishment of a human rights bureau in the\ncentre of Port-au-Prince.\n\nGE.13-10672 (E)\n\n070313 080313\n\n",

Méndez\nSummary\nThe present report focuses on certain forms of abuses in health-care settings that\nmay cross a threshold of mistreatment that is tantamount to torture or cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment or punishment. It identifies the policies that promote these practices\nand existing protection gaps.\nBy illustrating some of these abusive practices in health-care settings, the report\nsheds light on often undetected forms of abusive practices that occur under the auspices of\nhealth-care policies, and emphasizes how certain treatments run afoul of the prohibition on\ntorture and ill-treatment. It identifies the scope of State‟s obligations to regulate, control\nand supervise health-care practices with a view to preventing mistreatment under any\npretext.\nThe Special Rapporteur examines a number of the abusive practices commonly\nreported in health-care settings and describes how the torture and ill-treatment framework\napplies in this context. The examples of torture and ill-treatment in health settings\ndiscussed likely represent a small fraction of this global problem.\n\nGE.13-10577\n\n",

The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet\nbeen clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,889 in a total of 84 States. The Working\nGroup has been able to clarify 298 cases over the past five years.\nThe present report reflects the communications and cases examined by the Working\nGroup during its three sessions in 2012, covering the period 12 November 2011 to 9\nNovember 2012.

It is estimated that, on average, developing\ncountries lost between US$783 billion and US$1,138 billion in illicit financial outflows in\n2010 and that these flows have increased in real terms to 8.6 per cent over the period 2001–\n2010, suggesting that existing measures to tackle the problem have not had a significant\nimpact.\nMany of the countries affected by massive illicit financial outflows are burdened\nwith heavy external debts and have to make difficult choices concerning allocation of\nscarce national resources between debt service and provision of essential public services.\nCurtailing illicit financial outflows and ensuring the repatriation of illicit funds to the\ncountries of origin can increase the resources available to these countries for development,\npoverty alleviation and the realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social and\ncultural rights. Repatriation of illicit funds may also help ease the external debt burdens of\nthe countries of origin.\n\n*\n\nGE.13-11383\n\nLate submission.\n\n",

In order to define areas of possible advice and assistance by\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special\nprocedures pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/2, the present report examines\nthe recommendations of the Commission and the plans of the Government of Sri Lanka to\nimplement them, and to address alleged violations of international law. To date, the\nGovernment has made commitments on only selected recommendations of the\nCommission, and has not adequately engaged civil society in support of a more\nconsultative and inclusive reconciliation process. The Government has made significant\nprogress in rebuilding infrastructure; and while the majority of internally displaced persons\nhave been resettled, considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, reconciliation and\nresumption of livelihoods. The steps taken to investigate further allegations of serious\nviolations of human rights have also been inconclusive, and lack the independence and\nimpartiality required to inspire confidence. Meanwhile, continuing reports of extrajudicial\nkillings, abductions and enforced disappearance in the past year highlight the urgency of\naction to combat impunity. It is against this background that possible areas of technical\nassistance are identified, and recommendations are made.\n\nGE.13-10926\n\n",

A longstanding exception to this rule is that a State may incur responsibility\nwhere there is a failure to exercise due diligence to prevent or respond to certain acts or\nomissions of non-State actors.

The main goal of the report is to encourage States to develop\nand implement effective and sustainable legal aid schemes to enable individuals to exercise\nand enjoy a number of human rights, including the rights to a fair trial and to an effective\nremedy. The Special Rapporteur considers that legal aid should be ensured both in criminal\nand in non-criminal cases, and encompass all stages of judicial or extrajudicial procedures,\nthus contributing to the elimination of obstacles that hamper access to justice through the\nprovision of assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal counsel, representation\nand access to the court system.\nFollowing a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in\n2012, the thematic section of the present report consists of three parts.

Its main aim is to evaluate the implementation of the\nrecommendations made to Côte d’Ivoire by the various United Nations mechanisms,\nincluding those made by the 2011 international commission of inquiry. This report also\npresents an update on the human rights situation in Côte d’Ivoire for the period 13 October\n2012 to 31 May 2013.\nThe Independent Expert’s visit coincided with regional and local elections and\nallowed him to observe the current drive towards democracy. He noted that these elections\nwere largely a technical success, which was testament to the authorities’ better use of\ndemocratic mechanisms. Nevertheless, the boycott of the elections by opposition parties,\nparticularly the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), weakened the elections’ legitimacy.\nThe Independent Expert observed that opposition parties continue to show mistrust\nfor the Government, despite its calls for dialogue. He calls on the Government to continue\nthis dialogue in a frank and sincere manner, including all political parties in the democratic\nprocess in order to encourage more peaceful participation in the next elections in 2015, and\nto consider the need to reform the Independent Electoral Commission and update the\nelectoral roll.\nIn terms of security, although the number of attacks originating outside the country\ndecreased significantly between January and April 2013, in the Independent Expert’s view\nthe situation remains fragile owing to numerous internal factors, such as the activities of\nmilitia in the west of the country and the delays in disarming former fighters. Moreover, the\nviolence committed by the dozos and the Forces Républicaines de Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI)\nremains a significant internal security threat.\n\n* Late submission.\nGE.13-15028 (E)\n\n200114 230114\n\n*1315028*\n\n",

The aim of these initiatives is\nto reduce the debt burdens of the beneficiary countries to levels deemed “sustainable” by\nthe two institutions and to help fund poverty-reducing expenditures and progress towards\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\nAccording to the World Bank and IMF, these debt relief efforts have “significantly\nreduced” the debt burdens of the participating low-income heavily indebted poor countries\nwhile enabling them to scale up “poverty-reducing” expenditures. To the extent that it can\nbe shown that increased social spending in HIPC completion point countries is the result of\ndebt relief, it can be argued that the initiatives have had a positive impact on poverty\nreduction. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship between debt relief\nand increased poverty-reducing expenditure. Indeed, the empirical evidence on the social\nimpacts of the two international debt relief schemes presents an inconclusive picture.\nNot intended to be a permanent mechanism to relieve the external debt burdens of\nthe recipient countries, the HIPC Initiative is now winding down and the future of\ninternational debt relief efforts remains uncertain. In this context, the present report, which\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.13-14624\n\n",

Participation is a basic\nhuman right in itself, a precondition or catalyst for the realization and enjoyment of other\nhuman rights, and of fundamental importance in empowering people living in poverty to\ntackle inequalities and asymmetries of power in society.

This report addresses laws and regulations\nrestricting artistic freedoms as well as economic and financial issues significantly\nimpacting on such freedoms.

Focusing on sustainability in the realization the human rights to water and sanitation,\nthe Special Rapporteur examines how the rights to water and sanitation can and must be\nmet for present and future generations.

After addressing the\nrelevance of sustainability to the core human rights concepts of “progressive realization”\nand “non-retrogression”, the Special Rapporteur explains how the normative content and\nprinciples of the human rights to water and sanitation contribute to ensuring sustainability.\nUsing the human rights framework, the Special Rapporteur analyses States’\ncommon approaches to water and sanitation, particularly in adopting measures both during\ntimes of normalcy and during economic and financial crises, and shows how those\napproaches often fail to incorporate sustainability. She then demonstrates that the human\nrights framework can and should facilitate improvement in such policies.

Towards that end, he shared a first draft of the road map\nwith the Government in early 2013.\nThe Independent Expert considered it expedient to focus the visit entirely on\npreparing the ground for the road map. This meant that the visit was limited primarily to\nMogadishu, where he met with the President and his cabinet as well as with the African\nUnion Mission in Somalia, United Nations agencies and members of civil society. He was\nthus unable to visit other parts of Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland, as he\nusually does. He hopes to do that during his next trip to Somalia before the twenty-fourth\nsession of the Human Rights Council.\nFollowing his visit, the Government announced its decision to adopt a human rights\nroad map, which was welcomed by the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session,\nduring which it took the decision to hold, at its twenty-fourth session, a stand-alone highlevel interactive dialogue with the aim of exploring how all stakeholders can work\neffectively towards the finalization and implementation of the road map and the realization\nof human rights in Somalia (Council decision 23/114).\nThe present report contains a broad outline of the human rights issues proposed for\nconsideration in the road map, together with short descriptions of each of them.

Subedi\nSummary\nHaving produced four substantive and substantial reports with a thorough analysis of\nthe situation of human rights and the challenges that Cambodia faces in terms of the\npromotion and protection of human rights since his appointment by the Human Rights\nCouncil in March 2009, the Special Rapporteur focused his last two missions to the country –\none conducted in December 2012 and the other in May 2013 – on the follow-up to the\nrecommendations made in his reports and on monitoring the situation of human rights in\nCambodia. His previous annual reports to the Council focused on judicial, parliamentary and\nelectoral reform and on the human rights impact of economic and other land concessions. His\nreports included a series of recommendations designed to assist the Government with their\nreform agenda and the process of democratization in the country. Rather than taking up a\nnew human rights theme, he considered it timely to take stock of the progress made on the\nfollow-up to the recommendations made in his previous reports.\nThe reception that the Special Rapporteur received from the Government during his\nmission to the country in December 2012 was a frosty one during which no senior member of\nthe Government was available to meet with him. In the wake of the publication of two major\nreports by the Special Rapporteur – one on electoral reform and the other one on economic\nand other land concessions – he was subjected to some raw remarks descending to the\npersonal level. This was highly regrettable, as the focus of the dialogue between the Special\nRapporteur and the Government should remain strictly on the substance of the work he is\nmandated to carry out by the United Nations, and not on him as a person. However, the\nGovernment cooperated with him during his mission to the country in May 2013, when he\nmet with a broad range of stakeholders. They included senior members of the Government\nwho were forthcoming with information, prepared to acknowledge deficiencies where they\nexisted, and willing to work with the Special Rapporteur in a constructive manner to address\nthe remaining challenges concerning greater protection of human rights, stronger democracy\nand genuine rule of law in Cambodia. He was satisfied with the level of engagement and\ndialogue with various government interlocutors; the dialogue was candid, cordial and\nconstructive.\nWhile the private meetings with senior members of the Government were\n\nGE.13-16118\n\n",

Nevertheless Côte d’Ivoire has been traumatized by the many\ncrises it has suffered in the past decade and is still recovering.\nIn this context, the holding on 11 December 2011 of legislative elections judged\nby all observers to have been well organized from a technical point of view, despite the\npolarization stemming from the handing over of former president Laurent Gbagbo to the\nInternational Criminal Court on 30 November 2011 and the boycott of the elections by\nhis party, was an important step in the country’s return to normal. Yet many challenges\nremain. Some are linked to deep-rooted causes that pre-date the post-election crisis,\nincluding the link between access to land and tensions between communities, especially\nin the country’s western part.\nThe challenges include, among others, restoring security throughout the country\nand along its borders, reforming the security sector, restoring the rule of law and justice,\ncombating impunity, promoting reconciliation, strengthening social cohesion and the\nability to live together, restoring the State’s sovereignty and re-establishing its services\ncountrywide, reviving the economy, reducing poverty, and ensuring the\nprotection/return/reintegration of displaced and refugee populations.\nIn this context the independent expert also wishes to highlight the most\nsignificant human rights violations brought to his attention, such as violations of the\nright to life, acts of torture, degrading and inhuman treatment, arbitrary arrests, rapes,\nviolations of freedom of expression, racketeering and extortion, attacks and violent acts\nagainst religious buildings and leaders, and violations of the right to education, health\nand food.

Méndez\n*\n\nSummary\nIn the present report, the Special Rapporteur gives an overview of his activities\nduring the reporting cycle in relation to country visits, pending visit requests, presentations,\nconsultations, communications and press statements.\nThe thematic focus of the report, commissions of inquiry, was selected by the\nSpecial Rapporteur to help deepen the international community’s understanding on when\nsuch commissions should be created by States in response to patterns or practices of torture\nand other forms of ill-treatment. Furthermore, the purpose of the report is to generate\nfurther discussion of the standards that apply to the establishment and conduct of\ncommissions of inquiry, and the relationship between such commissions and the fulfilment\nby States of their international legal obligations with regard to torture and other forms of\nill-treatment.\nThe Special Rapporteur examines the scope and role of commissions of inquiry in\nthe international human rights context and pays tribute to the earlier work on this subject,\nincluding the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and\nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Protocol) and\nthe updated set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through\naction to combat impunity. The Special Rapporteur evaluates the objectives of\ncommissions of inquiry and the added value of such mechanisms.\nIn the report, the Special Rapporteur also provides an overview of the current\npractice of commissions of inquiry at the international, regional and national levels. He\nnotes that, where possible, the possibility of national commissions of inquiry ought to be\npursued before the establishment of an international commission.

That refusal means that the report is neither edited nor\ntranslated into the other United Nations official languages.\nThe regular decision over the years by the UN Secretariat to grant such a waiver was\nbased on the peculiarities of the Working Group's mandate. Compared to other special\nprocedures (with the exception of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention) the Working\nGroup is specifically mandated to deal with individual cases on a humanitarian basis. Those\ncases are registered in a database and are followed-up every year until clarified. This year,\nthe Working Group is still following up the individual cases of almost 43, 000 persons in\n82 States.\nThe report each year gives an account of how the Working Group is fulfilling its\nhumanitarian mandate: it contains communications to and from Member States and\nstatistics on cases. Most of all, it includes the names of those people who have disappeared\nand whose disappearance was communicated to the Working Group during the reporting\nperiod. The fact that these matters and names are not recorded or made public in any other\nUnited Nations document, makes the report a unique tool in the fight against enforced\ndisappearances and at the service of Governments and officials as well as civil society.

The report also includes a discussion of the independent expert’s\nexpected priorities for her first term as mandate holder. In addition the report also contains\na review of the activities of the former independent expert on minority issues, Ms. Gay\nMcDougall, since the submission of her previous report to the Human Rights Council in\nMarch 2011 until she completed her tenure as mandate holder on 31 July 2011. During this\nperiod, the mandate holder undertook two official country missions, to Rwanda and to\nBulgaria, to consult on minority issues in those countries.\nThe report contains an update on the work of the Forum on Minority Issues\nfollowing the fourth session of the Forum in November 2011, which focused on\n“Guaranteeing the rights of minority women and girls”. The independent expert highlights\nthe fact that women and girls belonging to minorities frequently face multiple or\nintersecting forms of discrimination emanating from their status as members of minorities\nand as women or girls. This may make minority women and girls particularly vulnerable to\nviolations and the denial of their rights in both public and private life. Without explicit\nrecognition of the different life experiences of minority women and men, such\ndiscrimination will often go unnoticed and not be addressed adequately. The Forum\naddressed the challenges and opportunities for minority women to fully enjoy all their\nrights, including the rights to have access to quality education, to take part effectively in\neconomic life, to access labour markets and to participate fully in social, cultural and\npolitical life.\n\nGE.12-10012\n\n",

The increasing use of criminal laws to suppress media freedom is also\nexamined, as well as the continuing problem of impunity. Emphasizing that the problem in\nensuring the protection of journalists worldwide lies not in the lack of international\nstandards, but in the inability or unwillingness of Governments to take effective measures,\nthe report examines the issue of impunity and ways in which some States have attempted to\ncombat this phenomenon. Chapter IV draws conclusions and provides relevant\nrecommendations for different stakeholders, including States, United Nations agencies,\nregional actors and civil society.\n\n*\n\nGE.12-13787\n\nLate submission.\n\n",

The discussion of State\nobligations is followed by the analysis of such occupational health issues as environmental\nand industrial hygiene; prevention and reduction of the working population‟s exposure to\nharmful substances; challenges posed by emerging technologies; minimization of hazards\nin the workplace; and availability and accessibility of occupational health services. The\nSpecial Rapporteur then elaborates on the prospective and retrospective components of\naccountability, as well as remedies for violations related to occupational health.

This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption by Brazil of\nthe Refugee Act, which has been referred to as a model for asylum legislation in the region.\nAs a State party to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the\nProtocol thereto of 1967, and sponsor of the Brasilia Declaration on the Protection of\nRefugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas of 2010, Brazil continues to demonstrate its\ncommitment and remains a pioneer in refugee protection. As an example, a generous\ninterpretation of Brazilian refugee legislation has allowed the national commission for\nrefugees, CONARE, to recognize as refugees persons fleeing persecution because of their\nsexual orientation and gender identity, thus reinforcing the protection of lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, transgender and intersex persons who are victims of forced displacement.\nUNHCR continues to welcome the efforts made by Brazil to provide a durable\nsolution to refugees and others of concern to UNHCR. The solidarity resettlement\nprogramme has granted protection to and found solutions for many refugees over past years\nand includes a fast-track modality, which enables the emergency resettlement of refugees\nwith urgent protection needs. The local integration of refugees is also a priority for the\nGovernment, as demonstrated by the granting of permanent residency to refugees from\nAngola and Liberia and the establishment of State committees in charge of the coordination\nof policies and interventions for the local integration of refugees.\nUNHCR also applauds the Government of Brazil for its commitment to the\nprotection of stateless persons. Brazil is a party to both the Convention relating to the Status\nof Stateless Persons of 1954 and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961.\nWith regard to the latter Convention, it is worth mentioning constitutional amendment\n54/07, which allows for acquisition of nationality by children born abroad through a simple\nconsular registration and represents an important example of the prevention of\n\nGE.12-16778\n\n",

Subedi\nSummary\nThe year 2011 witnessed the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Peace\nAgreements, which consolidated the peace process in Cambodia. The mandate of the Special\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia has its origins in the Agreements.\nAs the country approaches its general election, in July 2013, the time is ripe to take stock of\nthe progress made over the past 20 years and to tackle the governance challenges that persist.\nCambodia has made significant progress since the conclusion of the Agreements,\npassing various milestones in strengthening democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It\nhas held four national or parliamentary elections and three local or commune elections. The\nlatest round of commune elections was held on 3 June 2012 and National Assembly elections\nare scheduled for July 2013. These are crucial events in the country’s journey towards\ndemocratization. It was in this context that the Special Rapporteur focused his sixth mission\nto the country, in December 2011, on a human rights assessment of State institutions relevant\nto the electoral process in Cambodia, including the laws, policies and practices applicable to\nelections in the context of the country’s international human rights obligations to ensure free\nand fair periodic elections. The mission was productive. A seventh mission, in May 2012,\nfocused on the impact of economic land concessions on people’s rights in Cambodia, and is\nthe subject of an addendum to the present report.\nOn the basis of the information that he received during his sixth mission, the Special\nRapporteur is of the view that reforms should be carried out to ensure that elections in\nCambodia are free and fair and that Cambodians can exercise their right to democratic\ngovernance in a free political environment. He is concerned by the capacity gaps that persist\nin the electoral process. Free and fair elections can take place only when there is a free\npolitical environment and the people are able to exercise their rights and freedoms, such as\nfreedom of expression and assembly and the right to stand for election. To hold credible\nelections, the Government must ensure high standards in line with its international human\nrights obligations before, during and after the casting of votes.\n\nGE.12-15339\n\n",

Baderin\nSummary\nThe present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council\nresolution 18/16, in which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Independent\nExpert for a period of one year and requested him to assist the Government of the Sudan in\nidentifying areas of assistance that would aid the Sudan to fulfil its human rights\nobligations, and to submit a report for the Council’s consideration at its twenty-first\nsession.\nThe Independent Expert undertook his first mission to the Sudan from 10 to 14 June\n2012 and met with a wide variety of actors, including Government representatives,\ninternational partners and civil society organizations. On the basis of the information\ngathered during his meetings with stakeholders, the Independent Expert’s initial impression\nwas that of a general willingness on the part of the Government of the Sudan to fulfil its\ninternational human rights obligations and to improve the situation of human rights in the\ncountry; indeed, the State has already taken some important steps in that direction.\nThe Independent Expert noted, however, the important human rights concerns raised\nby certain international partners that the Government must take seriously if it is to secure\ncooperation from them for the realization of the necessary technical assistance and\ncapacity-building on human rights, areas of concern that are briefly described in the present\nreport. He concludes that there is a need to strengthen confidence-building between the\nGovernment of the Sudan and relevant international partners in order to ensure continued\nconstructive engagement to improve the situation of human rights in the Sudan.\n\nGE.12-16190\n\n",

In chapter III, he focuses on the\nfoundation of the mandate and presents an argument for the importance of taking a\ncomprehensive approach to address gross violations of human rights and serious violations\nof international humanitarian law, as noted in the resolution establishing the mandate, an\napproach that combines the elements of truth-seeking, justice initiatives, reparations and\nguarantees of non-recurrence in a complementary and mutually reinforcing manner. In\nchapter IV, he sketches the implementation strategy for the mandate, highlighting the\nimportance of carrying out further work on the linkages between these four different\nelements of the mandate, of drawing tighter connections with other types of policy\ninterventions such as development and security policies, and of improving the efficacy of\nthe measures in post-conflict and other contexts in which institutions are under severe\nstrain.\n\nGE.12-15858\n\n",

It presents a sample analysis of three\nsets of national legislation that represent distinct approaches to the issue. From that\nanalysis, the Working Group begins to identify common elements in national laws and\nsome of the challenges faced in regulating the sector.\nLastly, the Working Group makes recommendations for Member States, including\nencouraging them to continue to develop national legislation on private military and\nsecurity companies and to participate in the Working Group’s survey of national\nlegislation.\nAs the Working Group has previously noted, national legislation should be\ncomplemented by a strong international regulatory framework. The Working Group\nrecommends that Member States consider the possibility of developing a binding\ninternational instrument for the regulation of private military and security companies and\nurges all Member States to participate in the intergovernmental working group established\nby the Human Rights Council. The Working Group recommends that Member States\nensure accountability for human rights violations involving private military and security\ncompanies, and provide victims of human rights violations with an effective remedy.\n\nGE.12-14912\n\n",

She has found that stigma, as a deeply entrenched social and\ncultural phenomenon, lies at the root of many human rights violations and results in\nentire population groups being disadvantaged and excluded.\nThe Special Rapporteur seeks to convey an understanding of stigma and to\nelucidate its drivers. She links stigma explicitly to water, sanitation and hygiene before\nexamining different manifestations of stigma. She situates stigma in the human rights\nframework considering, in particular, human dignity, the human rights to water,\nsanitation, non-discrimination and equality, the prohibition of degrading treatment, and\nthe right to privacy. Based on this analysis, the Special Rapporteur seeks to identify\nappropriate strategies for preventing and responding to stigma from a human rights\nperspective, before concluding with a set of recommendations. She emphasizes that\nStates cannot fully realize the human rights to water and sanitation without addressing\nstigma as a root cause of discrimination and other human rights violations.\n\nGE.12-14898\n\n",

She also\noutlines the various forms of servile marriage, as defined in the Supplementary Convention\non the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to\nSlavery, and highlights the need to view such marriages as forms of slavery so as to better\ninform and shape actions to prevent servile marriage and support victims.

He then focuses on the need to respect and protect\nfreedom of religion or belief of persons belonging to religious minorities.\nIn his conceptual observations on this issue, he emphasizes that the rights of persons\nbelonging to religious minorities should be consistently interpreted and implemented from\na human rights perspective. Unlike some concepts of minority protection which were often\ndeveloped historically in the framework of bilateral or multilateral peace negotiations, the\nhuman rights-based approach takes respect for the self-understanding of human beings as\nits systematic starting point. The Special Rapporteur further points out that, in keeping with\nthe principle of normative universalism, the rights of persons belonging to religious\nminorities cannot be confined to the members of certain predefined groups. Instead, they\nshould be open to all persons who live de facto in the situation of a minority and are in\nneed of special protection to facilitate a free and non-discriminatory development of their\nindividual and communitarian identities.\nThe Special Rapporteur further describes patterns of typical violations of freedom of\nreligion or belief of persons belonging to religious minorities perpetrated by States and/or\nnon-State actors which show various problems that require concerted action. The report\nconcludes with a list of recommendations concerning general policies, domestic legal\nprovisions, administration and procedures, education, media, interreligious communication\nand awareness-raising in protecting and promoting the freedom of religion or belief of\npersons belonging to religious minorities.\n\nGE.12-18986\n\n",

However, challenges to the\nenjoyment of the rights of linguistic minorities exist in all regions and include restrictions\non the opportunities available to linguistic minorities to learn and receive education for\ntheir children in minority languages, and limitations on the use of minority languages in\npublic life and the media.

In the report, the Special\nRapporteur elaborates upon the concept of security of tenure as a component of the right to\nadequate housing. The backdrop is one of a global tenure insecurity crisis, manifesting\nitself in many forms and contexts—forced evictions, displacement resulting from\ndevelopment, natural disasters and conflicts and land grabbing—and evident in the millions\nof urban dwellers living under insecure tenure arrangements. The Special Rapporteur\ndiscusses existing guidance under international human rights law, raising questions\nregarding the precise State obligations with respect to ensuring security of tenure. She\nexamines the wide range of existing tenure arrangements, and the prevalent focus in policy\nand practice on one form of tenure: individual freehold. The Special Rapporteur also\ndiscusses selected operational and policy challenges pertaining to securing tenure. She\nconcludes by underscoring the need for more specific and comprehensive human rights and\noperational guidance on security of tenure.\n\nGE.12-18979\n\n",

It also transmitted a total of 104 urgent appeals to\n44 States concerning 606 individuals, including 56 women. States informed the Working\nGroup that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of detainees: in some cases,\ndetainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was assured that the detainees\nconcerned would be guaranteed a fair trial. The Working Group is grateful to those\nGovernments that heeded its appeals and took steps to provide it with the requested\ninformation on the situation of detainees. The Working Group engaged in continuous\ndialogue with countries that it visited particularly concerning its recommendations.\nInformation regarding the implementation of recommendations made by the Working\nGroup was received from the Government of Malta. During 2012, the Working Group\nvisited El Salvador. The report on this visit is contained in addendum 2 to the present\ndocument (A/HRC/22/44/Add.2).\nIn accordance with Council resolution 20/16 adopted on 6 July 2012, the Working\nGroup initiated preparations concerning the draft basic principles and guidelines on\nremedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or\ndetention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without\ndelay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention\nis not lawful. The draft basic principles and guidelines aim at assisting Member States in\nfulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. A report comprising the\nbasic principles and guidelines will be presented to the Human Rights Council in 2015.\n\nGE.12-18935 (E)\n\n180113 180113\n\n",

The Independent Expert notes that the relationship between\nhuman rights and the environment has been the subject of serious, sustained attention in\nmany different forums. Although some fundamental aspects of the relationship are now\nfirmly established, the Independent Expert explains that many issues related to the\nobligations that human rights law imposes regarding environmental protection need greater\nstudy and clarification. Therefore, the first priority of his mandate is to provide greater\nconceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.\nHe intends to take an evidence-based approach to determining the nature, scope and content\nof these obligations. To inform his work, the Independent Expert will actively consult and\nseek input from a wide spectrum of relevant stakeholders.\n\nGE.12-18972\n\n",

The late responses from\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to letters sent by the experts\nregrettably do not meet these criteria. Similarly, the Government has responded to less than\n7 per cent of the urgent appeals and allegation letters sent by the experts since they were\nrequested to report for the first time on the human rights situation in the country, in March\n2008.\nThe experts are of the view that the current mandate given to a group of seven\nthematic special procedures mandate holders, who undertake this task in addition to the\nconsiderable workload entailed by their respective mandates, does not have the necessary\nflexibility and reactivity to ensure a regular dialogue with the Congolese authorities, and is\ntherefore not the most suitable mechanism to respond to the specific needs of the country.\nBy visiting the country several times and by elaborating specific recommendations related\nto their respective mandates, which are still relevant and applicable to the human rights\nsituation in the country, they have made their maximum contribution to the improvement of\nthe situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe experts strongly believe that follow-up to the present recommendations\n(A/HRC/10/59) and assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in this regard, in\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.11-11656\n\n",

In spite of a growing commitment across regions to address\nviolence against children, this phenomenon continues to have a serious impact on the lives\nof millions of children. In this context, the Special Representative identifies areas of\nconcern to be given special attention in 2011: (a) promoting universal ratification of the\nOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; (b) conducting a global\nsurvey to assess progress in violence prevention and responses; and (c) addressing violence\nin the context of education and of the administration of justice.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.11-11445 (E)\n\n040311\n\n",

Méndez*\nSummary\nThis is the first report submitted by the incumbent Special Rapporteur to the Human\nRights Council. The Special Rapporteur took up his appointment on 1 November 2010,\nreplacing Manfred Nowak who had served two terms as Special Rapporteur.\nThe report gives an overview of the activities of the mandate over the reporting\ncycle, including the activities carried out by the former Special Rapporteur up to the end of\nhis mandate on 31 October 2010. The Special Rapporteur outlines his working methods and\nvision, and notes, in relation to follow-up country visits, that invitations from States to\nconduct follow-up visits constitute a good practice that should be disseminated.\nThe Special Rapporteur advocates a victim-centred approach to the work of his\nmandate. He believes that all human rights standards are subject to the norm of\n“progressive development,” in that they evolve in accordance with new repressive actions\nand features. In this regard, it is important to consolidate current interpretations of what\nconstitutes torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, and to insist\non effective implementation of States’ obligations to prevent and to punish violations. In\nkeeping with the progressive development of international jurisprudence, the Special\nRapporteur believes that expansive interpretations of norms are possible as long as they\nbetter protect individuals from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment. At the same time, such expansive interpretations should evolve from\nagreements among all stakeholders reached after frank and open debate. It is the role of the\nSpecial Rapporteur to generate such discussion as appropriate.\n\n*\n\nGE.11-10587\n\nLate submission.\n\n",

The 2010\nelectoral process concluded with the election of a new Congress and of President Juan\nManuel Santos Calderón, who took office in August.\nThe report recognizes the commitment to human rights expressed by the Santos\nadministration during its first months in office and welcomes the consolidation of the\ndrastic reduction in the practice known as “false positives”, which resulted in extrajudicial\nkillings. Other positive steps are the announcement of an ambitious land restitution policy\nand a more favourable stance towards human rights organizations.\nThe persistence of the internal armed conflict continues to affect the full enjoyment\nof human rights. All parties to the armed conflict, in particular guerrilla groups, continue to\nbreach international humanitarian law. This situation is exacerbated by the violence caused\nby illegal armed groups emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations, and\ndisputes among illegal armed actors to control drug trafficking.\nThe report further analyses several particular situations of concern and summarizes\nthe main activities carried out by OHCHR-Colombia.

Moreover, at its fortythird session in 1987, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1987/50\nentitled Question of human rights in Cyprus, which, inter alia, reiterated its previous calls\nfor the full restoration of all human rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to\nrefugees; called for the tracing of and accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without\nany further delay; and called for the restoration and respect of the human rights and\nfundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of movement, the freedom of\nsettlement and the right to property. It is in this light that this report reflects a variety of\nhuman rights-related issues.\nIn its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights to “continue with the fulfilment of their\nactivities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human\nRights and to update the relevant reports and studies”. The Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to preserve the\nprevious annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the\nCouncil. The last annual report on the question of human rights in Cyprus was submitted to\nthe Council at its thirteenth session in March 2010 (A/HRC/13/24).\nThe annex to this note, prepared by OHCHR and covering the period up to 30\nNovember 2010, is herewith transmitted to the Council. It provides an overview of human\nrights issues in Cyprus based on the available information. For the purpose of this report, in\nthe absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus, or of any specific monitoring\nmechanism, OHCHR has relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the\nhuman rights situation on the island.\nGE.11-10160\n\n",

Overall, the\nelections were conducted in accordance with international standards and the irregularities\nobserved were not such as to call into question their validity. However, the independent\nexpert notes that a number of acts of violence were committed before and after the electoral\ncampaign and that several opposition party meetings were not allowed to take place. He\nreports numerous claims that members of the opposition political parties were arrested and\nheld. The report also covers various incidents involving political violence, in particular\nclashes between young activists, grenade attacks and killings.\nConcerning the institutional context, the independent expert notes that \"national\nconsultations\" were held throughout the country on the establishment of a truth\nand reconciliation commission and a special tribunal to prosecute those responsible\nfor serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated\nduring the various conflicts that had taken place in Burundi. These national consultations\nended in March 2010 and the report was transmitted to the Head of State of Burundi\non 20 April 2010. Significant advances have also been made towards the establishment of\nan independent national human rights commission, through the adoption of a law\nestablishing such a commission, vested with substantial powers.\nThe independent expert reports further on the main allegations of human rights\nviolations brought to his attention, in particular violations of the right to life and to physical\nintegrity, largely attributed to State officials.

She urges States to see\nrecovery from the crises as an opportunity for change, a chance to rectify deeply\ningrained poverty and social exclusion, restore social cohesion and lay the foundations\nfor more equitable, sustainable societies.\nThe Independent Expert first identifies the human rights framework that States\nmust comply with when designing recovery measures. She notes that, while States have\ndiscretion to adopt policy measures according to their own context, human rights are not\ndispensable during times of economic hardship, and States must design and implement\nall policies according to their human rights obligations.\nThe Independent Expert analyses a number of recovery measures from a human\nrights perspective, highlighting their potential to threaten the enjoyment of economic,\nsocial and cultural rights. She then recommends measures that States should consider\ntaking to facilitate a human rights-based recovery from the crises. These innovative\nmeasures will assist States in moving as effectively and efficiently as possible towards\nthe full realization of economic, social and cultural rights.

Human rights abuses may spark\nor intensify conflict, and conflict may in turn lead to further human rights abuses. The\ngravity of the human rights abuses demands a response, yet in conflict zones the\ninternational human rights regime cannot possibly be expected to function as intended.\nSuch situations require that States take action as a matter of urgency, but there remains a\nlack of clarity among States with regard to what innovative, proactive and, above all,\npractical policies and tools have the greatest potential for preventing or mitigating businessrelated abuses in situations of conflict. In the present report, the Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other\nbusiness enterprises outlines a range of policy options that home, host and neighbouring\nStates have, or could develop, to prevent and deter corporate-related human rights abuses in\nconflict contexts.\n\n* The present report was submitted late in order that the most up-to-date information could be\nincluded.\n\nGE.11-13563\n\n",

It focuses on the promotion of equality of opportunity\nin education. The report also provides an overview of additional concerns that the Special\nRapporteur intends to study in the course of his mandate.\nEnsuring equality of opportunity in education is an overarching principle that is\nreflected in core human rights treaties. States have the duty to adopt measures to eradicate\ndiscrimination and ensure equal access for all to education. The promotion of equality of\nopportunity in education both in law and in fact is an ongoing challenge for all States, and\none that requires not only the elimination of discriminatory practices, but also the adoption\nof temporary special measures to bring about equality in fact with regard to education.

The Special\nRapporteur underscores the unique and transformative nature of the Internet not only to\nenable individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, but also a\nrange of other human rights, and to promote the progress of society as a whole. Chapter III\nof the report underlines the applicability of international human rights norms and standards\non the right to freedom of opinion and expression to the Internet as a communication\nmedium, and sets out the exceptional circumstances under which the dissemination of\ncertain types of information may be restricted. Chapters IV and V address two dimensions\nof Internet access respectively: (a) access to content; and (b) access to the physical and\ntechnical infrastructure required to access the Internet in the first place. More specifically,\nchapter IV outlines some of the ways in which States are increasingly censoring\ninformation online, namely through: arbitrary blocking or filtering of content;\ncriminalization of legitimate expression; imposition of intermediary liability; disconnecting\nusers from Internet access, including on the basis of intellectual property rights law; cyberattacks; and inadequate protection of the right to privacy and data protection.

Despite\nnormative standards having been set, the reality is that violence against women remains a\nglobal epidemic, which is further complicated when considering multiple and intersecting\nforms of discrimination. This thematic report examines such discrimination in the context\nof violence against women and provides a conceptual framework for further discussion.\nThe report acknowledges the reality that while multiple and intersecting forms of\ndiscrimination have contributed to and exacerbated violence against women, information\non the intersections between gender-based discrimination and other forms of\ndiscrimination, and the consequences thereof, are too often overlooked.\nIn addition to analyzing the forms, causes and consequences of multiple forms of\ndiscrimination as regards violence against women, this report also considers inter-gender\nand intra-gender differences, arguing that a one-size-fits-all programmatic approach is\ninsufficient for combating gender-based violence. Even though all women are at risk of\nexperiencing violence, not all women are equally susceptible to acts of violence.\nIt has been stated by this mandate that “the multiplicity of forms of violence against\nwomen as well as the fact that this violence frequently occurs at the intersection of different\ntypes of discrimination makes the adoption of multifaceted strategies to effectively prevent\nand combat this violence a necessity.”1\nThis report proposes a holistic approach to conceptualizing and addressing the issue\nby: (a) considering human rights as universal, interdependent and indivisible; (b) situating\n*\n1\n\nGE.11-13022\n\nLate submission.\nE/CN.4/2006/61, para. 16.\n\n",

This is\nboth as a result of recent discontent with the outcomes of solely economically focused\ndevelopment efforts, and the increasing recognition of the important role human rights play\nin securing the basic conditions necessary for living with dignity.\nThe Special Rapporteur examines the ways in which human rights, and the right to\nhealth framework more specifically, can add value to development policies and\nprogrammes. Using the example of HIV/AIDS, the Special Rapporteur considers projects\nin which a human rights-based approach has been utilized, and explores the value added of\nthat approach.\nThe report points to a number of challenges that remain in incorporating human\nrights into development work. In particular, the Special Rapporteur warns against adoption\nof a \"culture of evaluation\" to the detriment of human rights-based approaches. The report\nconcludes with recommendations to the United Nations, and other actors in the\ndevelopment and human rights fields, concerning ways to further strengthen the integration\nof development and human rights.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.11-12608\n\n",

The devastating\ndrought currently ravaging the Horn of Africa, compounded by conflict and the denial of\nhumanitarian assistance, has resulted in a declaration of famine in two regions of SouthCentral Somalia. Already in the course of the independent expert’s sixth visit to Somalia, in\nFebruary 2011, the drought had taken a heavy toll on livestock and food reserves. The full\nimpact of the drought can be seen on the Somali population, a large number of whom have\nbeen forced to flee their homes in search of food and succour. Deaths caused by\nmalnutrition have been documented among new arrivals in refugee camps in Kenya and\nEthiopia and into Mogadishu. The United Nations has already warned that, unless urgent\nmeasures are taken to increase the response, the famine will spread to the whole of southern\nSomalia within the next two months. This should not be allowed to happen and become\nanother blot on the conscience of mankind.\nApart from the drought and famine, the armed conflicts between Islamist insurgents\nand the Transitional Federal Government, supported by the troops of the African Union\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM), continues to cause deaths and injury to the civilian\npopulation. Indiscriminate shelling and firing in urban areas, and suicide and improvised\nexplosive attacks by the insurgent group Al-Shabaab, are the main causes.\nRecent offensive has resulted in territorial gains for AMISOM and Transitional\nFederal Government forces. On 6 August 2011, Al-Shabaab announced its withdrawal from\npositions it had held in Mogadishu for nearly two years. Although Al-Shabaab has been\nunder military pressure in Mogadishu from the combined operations of AMISOM and\nTransitional Federal Government forces for some time, its sudden withdrawal came as a\nsurprise.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to include the most recent developments.\n\nGE.11-15591\n\n",

Subedi\n\nSummary\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Peace\nAgreements in 1991, which set in motion the peace process in Cambodia. The mandate of\nthe Special Rapporteur has its origins in these Agreements. It is commendable that\nCambodia has achieved significant milestones in a number of areas. However, it still has a\nlong way to go to fulfil its obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by\nthe country. The international community should continue assisting Cambodia in its efforts\nto establish the rule of law and reconstruct State institutions.\nThe Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the state of various human\nrights issues, and especially freedom of expression and land and housing rights. He is of the\nview that the peaceful expression of opinion should not be dealt with under the Penal Code\nas is currently the case with crimes such as defamation and disinformation. He is also\nconcerned about the narrowing of space for people, including those belonging to different\npolitical parties, to express their views peacefully and without fear. He is particularly\nconcerned in this regard by the charges of incitement, defamation and dissemination of\ninformation that have been brought against human rights defenders, land rights activists\nand individuals of communities defending their land and housing rights in the face of\neviction.\nCambodia has enacted a number of laws designed to protect human rights, but it is\nlagging behind in their implementation. Many of the laws passed by Parliament and its own\ninternal rules fall short of the standards required by the principle of the rule of law. What\nprevails in Cambodia in a number of areas is rule by law rather than rule of law.\nThe present report focuses on an assessment of the independence and capacity of\nParliament as one of the State institutions responsible for upholding people’s rights.\nParliament in Cambodia has not been able to safeguard the freedom of speech of some of\nGE.11-15363\n\n",

The report covers the period from\nMay 2010 to May 2011.\nIn the report, the Special Representative highlights how children continue to be\ndisproportionately affected by armed conflict and to have their basic rights violated. She\nsheds light on the growing trend of attacks on schools and hospitals, which increasingly\ndeprives children in situations of armed conflict of education and access to health care. She\nalso discusses the complex issue of accountability of children involved in armed conflict\nand children’s access to justice, by examining how the current system enables child\nwitnesses and victims to give evidence against perpetrators.\nThe Special Representative acknowledges the progress made since the previous\nreporting period, especially with regard to the ratification of the Optional Protocol on the\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict and the signing of action plans to release children\nfrom armed groups. She nevertheless emphasizes the remaining challenges in addressing\ngrave violations against children, such as the limited progress in the development of plans\nof action for the release of children in some countries and the continued impunity of\nviolating parties.\nLastly, the Special Representative outlines a series of recommendations addressed to\nStates parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States that are under review of\nthe Human Rights Council universal periodic review mechanism, the Human Rights\nCouncil and Member States to further the protection of children’s rights and to alleviate the\nsuffering of children in armed conflict.\n\n* Late submission.\n** The annexes to the present document are reproduced as received, in the language of submission only.\n\nGE.11-15092 (E)\n\n050911\n\n",

Active and dignified\nageing for older persons requires reframing society’s concept of ageing to put more focus\non the continued participation of older persons in social, economic, cultural and civic life,\nas well as their continuous contributions to society.\nThe report underlines that the right-to-health approach is indispensable for the\ndesign, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of health-related policies and\nprogrammes to mitigate consequences of an ageing society and ensure the enjoyment of\nthis human right by older persons. Accordingly, health facilities, goods and services should\nbe made available, accessible, affordable, acceptable and be of good quality for older\npersons.\nThe report also notes that encouraging older persons to remain physically,\npolitically, socially and economically active for as long as possible will benefit not only the\nindividual, but also the society as a whole. It further concludes that the promotion and\nprotection of human rights of older persons should be of concern to everyone because\nageing is a process that will apply to all.\n\nGE.11-14361\n\n",

The growing awareness of the impact of extractive industries\non the rights of indigenous peoples is further raised by the concerns expressed by many of\nthe responses received confirming the assertion that these projects and industries are\nbecoming the greatest challenges to the exercise of the rights of indigenous peoples. This\nsituation is further evidenced by the lack of understanding of basic minimum standards on\nthe effects of extractive industries affecting indigenous peoples and about the role and\nresponsibility of the State to ensure protection of their rights.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes with the need to continue the study of this issue\nGE.11-14639\n\n",

Hazardous health-care waste includes\ninfectious waste, sharps, anatomical and pathological waste, obsolete or expired chemical\nproducts and pharmaceuticals, and radioactive materials.\nIn many countries, significant challenges persist with regard to the proper\nmanagement and disposal of health-care waste. The amount of waste generated by healthcare facilities in developing countries is increasing owing to the expansion of health-care\nsystems and services, a situation exacerbated by the lack of adequate technological and\nfinancial resources to ensure that health-care waste is managed and disposed of in a manner\nthat is safe for human health and the environment.\nMedical waste is often mixed with general household waste, and either disposed of\nin municipal waste facilities or dumped illegally. In health-care establishments where\nhazardous medical waste is incinerated, open burning and widespread deficiencies in the\noperation and management of small-scale medical waste incinerators result in incomplete\nwaste destruction, inappropriate ash disposal and dioxins emissions, which can be even\n40,000 times higher than emission limits set forth in the Stockholm Convention.\nContaminated sharps is the category of medical waste that attracts the most\nattention. Needle-stick injuries and reuse of infected sharps expose health-care workers and\nthe community as a whole to blood-borne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis\nGE.11-14422\n\n",

Over nine days of extensive meetings and consultations with representatives\nof the Government and civil society in the cities of Aden, Sana’a and Ta’izz, the\nAssessment Mission observed an overall situation in which many Yemenis, peacefully\ncalling for greater freedoms, an end to corruption and respect for the rule of law, have been\nmet with an excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by the State. Hundreds have\nbeen killed and thousands have suffered injuries, including loss of limbs.\nBy February 2011, Yemenis had taken to the streets either to call for governmental\nreforms or in support of the Government. In March 2011, 53 persons were reportedly killed\nin Change Square in Sana’a, an incident which led to the resignation of a number of\nministers, ambassadors, members of Parliament, members of the Shura Council (the Upper\nHouse), members of the ruling party, as well as the defection of General Ali Mohsen AlAhmar, who pledged to send his troops to protect the peaceful demonstrators in the Square.\nIn April 2011, a Cabinet of National Accord was initiated and signed by the opposition\ncoalition in May 2011, but not by the President of Yemen. At the end of May 2011,\nfollowing a riot and the brief kidnapping of security officials, Freedom Square in Ta’izz,\nwas forcefully cleared by security officials of the Government. Tents were burned and\ndozens of demonstrators were killed.

Given many misunderstandings concerning the meaning of\n“recognition” and the role of the State in this respect, the Special Rapporteur has decided to\nput a thematic focus on this issue in the present report. He distinguishes between three\ndifferent meanings of recognition: (a) “recognition” in the sense of the due respect for the\nstatus of all human beings as right holders by virtue of their inherent dignity; (b)\n“recognition” in terms of States providing for the possibility of obtaining the status of legal\npersonality, which religious or belief groups may need for the exercise of important\ncommunitarian aspects of their freedom of religion or belief; and (c) “recognition” in the\nsense of States according a specific privileged status position to some religious or belief\ncommunities.\nIn his conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur notes the\nimportance of clearly distinguishing between the different meanings within the concept of\nState recognition, in order to avoid possible misunderstandings that could negatively affect\nthe implementation of freedom of religion or belief, or even undermine its status as a\nuniversal human right. Consequently, States must ensure that all individuals can enjoy their\nfreedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief on the basis of respect for their inherent\nhuman dignity. Respect for freedom of religion or belief as a human right does not depend\non administrative registration procedures, as it has the status of a human right, prior to and\nindependent of any acts of State approval. States should furthermore offer appropriate\noptions for religious or belief communities to achieve the status of legal personality, which\nmay be needed to undertake important community functions relevant for the full enjoyment\nof freedom of religion or belief, which is a right of individuals to be exercised either alone\nor together with others.

In the report, he shows why undernutrition, micronutrient\ndeficiency and overnutrition are different dimensions of malnutrition that must be\naddressed together through a life-course approach. Existing food systems have failed to\naddress hunger, and at the same time encourage diets that are a source of overweight and\nobesity that cause even more deaths worldwide than does underweight. A transition\ntowards sustainable diets will succeed only by supporting diverse farming systems that\nensure that adequate diets are accessible to all, that simultaneously support the livelihoods\nof poor farmers and that are ecologically sustainable. Women, the principal caregivers of\nyoung children, must be enabled to make informed and autonomous decisions about food\nand feeding so that young children can enjoy the right to a level of nutrition that supports\nadequate growth, health and development. The adoption of a human rights framework can\nserve to ensure that short-term answers do not preclude the chances of identifying longterm solutions.\n\nGE.11-17569\n\n",

On that occasion, the Working Group launched a database to\nfacilitate access of victims, States and civil society to its Opinions and other materials.\nThe Working Group has visited Georgia and Germany at the invitation of their\nrespective Governments. The reports of these visits are contained in addenda to the present\ndocument (A/HRC/19/57/Add.2 and 3).\nThroughout the period 1 January to 30 November 2011, the Working Group\nadopted 68 Opinions concerning 105 persons in 31 countries. These Opinions are contained\nin the addendum 1 to the present document (A/HRC/19/57/Add.1).\nMoreover, during the period 18 November 2010–17 November 2011, the Working\nGroup transmitted 108 urgent appeals to 45 Governments concerning 1,629 persons (1,526\nmen, 99 women and 4 minors). Governments and sources reported that 21 persons were\nreleased.\nInformation about the implementation of recommendations made by the Working\nGroup to the Governments of countries visited was received from the Governments of\nAngola and Colombia.\nThis report includes thematic issues to which the Working Group has devoted its\nattention in 2011, namely the exceptional character of pretrial detention and the human\nright of habeas corpus. The Working Group also takes the opportunity to reflect upon the\nimpact of its work, cooperation with other United Nations bodies and international and\nregional instruments for the protection and promotion of human rights, and the need to\nrevisit the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In connection with the\nlatter, the Working Group has held informal consultations with representatives of\nGovernments and civil society in preparation of its Deliberation No. 9 on the definition and\nscope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in customary international law.\n\nGE.11-17590\n\n",

The report reflects some positive\ndevelopments since the previous report (A/HRC/10/53), including in relation to policies on\nviolence against women and reducing discrimination. Though Nepal’s peace process —\nwhich began with a peace agreement that formally ended a ten-year internal armed conflict\n— has delivered improvements in the human rights situation since 2006, it has lost\nconsiderable momentum over the past year, giving rise to increasing concerns about longerterm peace and stability. Political instability, the impasse in the implementation of several\nkey provisions in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, de facto impunity for serious\nhuman rights violations and abuses, and deficiencies in the rule of law framework\naggravate an already weakened public security situation and have a negative impact on the\noverall human rights situation. The widespread inequality and discrimination that gave rise\nto the conflict persist and expectations that the new political order signalled by the 2006\npeople’s movement would foster greater respect for human rights and democracy have been\nseverely tested. Despite many challenges, the peace process in Nepal continues to hold\npromise, provided all parties recommit themselves to the human rights principles at the\ncentre of the peace agreement.\n\n* The present report was submitted late in order that the latest developments in the peace\nprocess could be included.\n\nGE.10-10449\n\n",

It records, among other issues, the significant progress made in terms of a drastic\nreduction in the number of complaints of extrajudicial executions and the continuous\nprosecution of members of Congress and public officials for alleged links with paramilitary\norganizations.\nThe report recognizes the Government’s openness to international scrutiny, which it\nhas demonstrated by receiving four Special Rapporteurs and self-monitoring the\nrecommendations of the universal periodic review. The High Commissioner acknowledges\nthe spirit of cooperation that exists between the Government and OHCHR-Colombia and\nthe commitment of the Government to address human rights challenges.\nThe report demonstrates how the internal armed conflict continues to pose many\nchallenges for the country, including the complete disregard for international humanitarian\nlaw by guerrilla groups. This situation is exacerbated by violence against civilians\ncommitted by illegal armed groups that emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary\norganizations, links between illegal armed groups and drug trafficking, and the particularly\nacute impact of the internal armed conflict on indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian\ncommunities.\n\n* The present report is being circulated in all official languages.

However, she is concerned that improvement in the human rights\nsituation in the country, critical to achieving a well-functioning democracy, has been\nlimited and that the human rights situation in the country remains extremely problematic.\nThrough interaction with various parts of the United Nations human rights system,\nincluding the High Commissioner, the Human Rights Council and its special procedures, as\nwell as the treaty bodies, numerous recommendations have been made to the Government\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, yet very limited progress has been made in their\nimplementation. Consequently, the Congolese people remain insecure in enjoying even\ntheir most fundamental human rights.\nAs an emerging “recommendation fatigue” can be observed, the approach of this\nreport is not to make new recommendations to the Congolese authorities, but rather to\nrecall conclusions and recommendations made in particular by the High Commissioner and\nseven thematic special procedures in their previous reports to the Council, as well as by\nother special procedures and treaty bodies.1 The report assesses the Government’s response\n\n* Late submission.\n1\n\nThe recommendations referenced in this report are extracted from the following documents:\nconclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture, CAT/C/DRC/CO/1; United\nNations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO), “The Human Rights Situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo during the period January to June 2007”; report of the Special Rapporteur on\n\nGE.10-10563 (E)\n\n230210\n\n",

This report further provides an update on the\nachievements of technical assistance in the field of human rights.\nThe year 2009 was a difficult one for Afghanistan as hard-won gains, particularly in\nrelation to human rights, were put in jeopardy. Confidence in the state-building project\ndiminished as many Afghans questioned the commitment of elected authorities and their\ninternational partners to safeguarding their core rights and freedoms.\nThe escalation and spread of armed conflict resulted in the highest number of\ncivilian casualties recorded since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 and in the further\nerosion of humanitarian space. While the armed opposition was responsible for the\nmajority of civilian casualties, deaths as a result of air strikes by international forces\ncontinued to be a high-profile and contentious issue. However, new tactical directives,\nadopted by the international forces to reduce civilian casualties, appear to have had a\npositive impact. Attacks by anti-Government elements (AGEs) produced high levels of\nviolence including, in particular, around the presidential and provincial council elections\nheld in August 2009. The presidential election, widely regarded as a deeply flawed process,\nfurther weakened support for, and confidence in, the Government and its international\npartners, as well as the post-Bonn Agreement state-building project.\nWhile greater numbers of women stood for election to public office, threats against\nwomen in public life and crimes of sexual violence remained serious human rights\nconcerns. The adoption of the Shia Personal Status Law, which legitimizes discriminatory\npractices against women, represented a setback for women’s rights. Widespread impunity\ncontinued to undermine effective governance in Afghanistan and little progress was\nachieved in terms of accountability for crimes that are directly associated with a long\nhistory of abuse of power.

In the present report, the Working Group examines the general situation of people of\nAfrican descent in Ecuador, describes the position in which people of African descent find\nthemselves and the situations that expose them to discrimination, and outlines the action\ntaken at various levels for their well-being. It concludes with recommendations that the\nWorking Group believe will, if implemented, make tangible improvements in the situation\nof people of African descent in Ecuador.\nDuring its visit to Ecuador, the Working Group found that the problems faced by\npeople of African descent in the country related mainly to a lack of access to such basic\nservices as adequate housing, health care and education, disproportionately high levels of\nunemployment and representation in detention centres, an undervaluing of the Afrodescendent contribution to the national identity and the negative representation of Afrodescendents in the media. The Working Group attributes this, in large part, to structural\nracism that exists as a result of the colonial past of Ecuador, which informs its collective\npsyche to the present day.\nIn this respect, the Working Group appreciates that the Government of Ecuador is\nopen, aware of the existing problems and committed to facing these challenges with\ninnovative programmes and legislative initiatives. The Working Group is particularly\nimpressed by the new Constitution adopted in 2008, which allows for advances to be made\nin the protection and promotion of the human rights of all vulnerable groups, including the\npopulation of African descent. Such elements as the recognition and protection of the\ncollective rights of people of African descent are forward-thinking initiatives that will go a\n\nGE.10-10207 (E)\n\n010210\n\n",

His global\nassessment is based on a detailed study of the phenomena of torture, cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment or punishment, including an assessment of conditions of detention, in\nthe world today, contained in document A/HRC/13/39/Add.5. Based on the study, he\nobserves that torture remains a global phenomenon and is practised widely in many\ncountries, the major structural reason being the malfunctioning of the administration of\njustice and, consequently the lack of respect for safeguards. Moreover, he maintains that, in\npractice, most States parties to the Convention against Torture have failed to fulfil their\nobligations, such as criminalizing torture, investigating allegations, prosecuting\nperpetrators and providing redress for victims of torture. He further holds that, in many\ncountries, conditions of detention in police custody, pretrial detention, other detention\nfacilities and sometimes correctional institutions for convicted prisoners, amount to\ninhuman or degrading treatment: detainees, whether deprived of their liberty for justified or\nless justified reasons, belong to the most vulnerable and forgotten sectors of our societies.\nHe also recalls that other forms of widespread cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment include corporal punishment and excessive police violence during arrest, in\nreacting to demonstrations and political gatherings, combating riots and similar law\nenforcement activities. States also do not live up to the standard of due diligence required\nby the obligation not to commit torture by acquiescence when combating torture and illtreatment by private actors, including harmful traditional practices, such as female genital\nmutilation, domestic violence and trafficking in human beings, notably of women and\nchildren.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-10042 (E)\n\n250210\n\n",

Accordingly, the report draws from\ncontributions received from Member States and other relevant stakeholders in response to\nthe above resolution, as well as from outcomes of major events, including the United\nNations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on\nDevelopment held in New York in June 2009.\nThe report highlights potential human rights issues raised in these deliberations, reports\nand contributions. They indicate that, while it is still too early to assess the full impact of\nthe crisis — as some of its longer-term effects continue to affect different countries and\nregions in varying degrees — it is clear that the global crisis has the potential to reverse or\nslow down the progress made so far towards achieving the internationally agreed\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. The report also notes\nthat, while recent economic forecasts suggest that the crisis may be tapering off, it will take\nsome time before its longer-term impact on individuals and their human rights is fully\nknown. A number of potential impacts were raised in various deliberations, reports and\nconferences, such as an increase in global poverty or unemployment; a possible decrease in\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-10930 (E)\n\n240210\n\n",

The States informed\nthe Working Group that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of the detainees:\nin some cases, the detainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was assured\nthat the detainees concerned would be guaranteed a fair trial.\nThe Working Group has sought to engage in a continuous dialogue with those\ncountries visited by the Working Group, in respect of which it had recommended changes\nto domestic legislation governing detention or the adoption of other measures. Information\nabout the implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group to the\nGovernments of countries visited in 2007 was received from the Governments of Norway\nand Equatorial Guinea. The Government of Angola requested an extension of the deadline\nfor submitting its comments.\nThe present report includes several issues which have given rise to concern during\n2009.

The passage of the Chieftaincy Act, the ratification of the\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and various sensitization\nprogrammes organized on the Child Rights Act, the Domestic Violence Act, the\nRegistration of Customary Marriage and the Divorce Act were notable in this regard. The\nCapacity of civil society organizations, government officials and the Human Rights\nCommission was also developed through training and other activities.\nProgress has been made in strengthening the rule of law. An active role was played\nby the Anti-Corruption Commission in taking action against corrupt practices. Activities\ncarried out to strengthen the justice sector institutions, including the judiciary, prison and\nthe police, were significant.\nProgress in improving prison conditions has also been made. The supply of\nnecessary logistics, the provision of water and regular supplies of food marked a definite\nimprovement in prison conditions. However, challenges remain, as detention by police for\nperiods beyond the lawful detention period, the poor condition of police detention cells,\ninadequate supplies of medicine in prisons and overcrowding in some of the prisons\ncontinue to pose a threat to the protection of the rights of accused persons.\nThe Government adopted the second poverty reduction strategy in the name of the\nAgenda for Change. The strategy aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of\npeople. The Government also adopted a strategy to address the challenges in the health\nsector.

He then analyses the earthquake’s impact on people’s\nrights. He draws attention in particular to the consequences for internally displaced persons,\nnot only in Port-au-Prince but in other regions of the country as well. He highlights the\nincreased risks and the particularly difficult situation of vulnerable groups, a situation\naggravated by the earthquake, especially for women, who often suffer gender-based violence,\nchildren separated from their families, orphans, restavek children, persons with pre-existing\ndisabilities, and persons newly disabled by the earthquake. In view of the persisting\nhumanitarian crisis, he stresses the need to suspend all forced returns to Haiti.\nThe independent expert also examines the earthquake’s impact on the public institutions\nand the cornerstones of the rule of law. He describes in particular the situation of Haiti’s\nNational Police, justice system, prisons and Ombudsman’s Office following the earthquake.\nHe also notes the importance of incorporating a legal perspective in the country’s\nreconstruction. He points as well to the need to continue the reforms which he evaluated in\nhis report of June 2009 (A/HRC/11/5).\n\n___________\n* Document submitted late.\n\nGE.10-13204 (EXT)\n\n",

Against this background, the present\nreport is aimed at providing an analysis of how racism, racial discrimination and conflict\ninterrelate. Since the impact of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\nintolerance may vary depending on the stage of the conflict, the Special Rapporteur on\ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance\nexamines three situations, namely, before, during and after a conflict.\nIn chapter II, the Special Rapporteur analyses how racism, racial discrimination,\nxenophobia and related intolerance may act as factors contributing to the triggering of\ntensions or acts of violence. In doing so, he focuses on issues relating to the debates\nsurrounding the concept of so-called “national identity”, socio-economic discrimination\naffecting individuals along group lines and the political manipulation of racist or nationalist\nideology. These issues, if unaddressed or dealt with in an inappropriate manner, might\ncontribute to the triggering of tensions and eventually conflict.\nIn chapter III, the Special Rapporteur examines how hate speech based on racist\nideology may exacerbate and aggravate violence perpetrated against certain individuals or\ngroups of individuals in situations of conflict. In his view, racist ideology tends to create a\nculture of victimization and to dehumanize certain categories of persons believed to be less\nequal. In situations of conflict, victimization and dehumanization may then become\neffective tools to incite people to commit acts of violence against specific individuals and\ngroups of individuals.\nIn chapter IV, taking the view that it is necessary to address adequately the root\ncauses of a conflict in order to avoid the resurgence of tensions and violence, the Special\n\nGE.10-12566 (E)\n\n190410\n\n",

Focusing on the challenges regarding the scope and content of cultural rights, she\nreviews the relevant existing provisions in United Nations human rights instruments, and\ndevelops her initial thoughts on the interaction among the principle of universality of\nhuman rights, the recognition and implementation of cultural rights and the need to respect\ncultural diversity (chap. II).\nAware that many other United Nations mechanisms have received mandates which\nrelate to cultural rights, the independent expert has committed to coordinating with other\nmechanisms (chap. III).\nThe independent expert has also selected a list of priority issues she proposes to\naddress. These issues relate to two main topics: (a) cultural rights, globalization of\nexchanges and of information, and development processes; and (b) participation, access and\ncontribution to cultural life, without any discrimination (chap.

Social pensions consist\nof cash benefits received by persons above a given age that do not require prior compulsory\ncontributions from beneficiaries, employers or the State. Social pensions are an important\ndimension of social security systems. States are obliged progressively to ensure the right to\nsocial security and the right to an adequate standard of living to all individuals within the\ncountry. These rights are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nseveral international human rights treaties and International Labour Organization\nconventions. Considering the vulnerability of older persons, States must take appropriate\nmeasures to establish social security schemes that provide benefits to all older persons\nwithout discrimination of any kind and ensure equal rights for men and women. Today,\nlarge proportions of the population work outside the formal employment sector and\ntraditional informal support systems for older people are changing under the pressure of\nincreased longevity, widespread poverty, the impact of HIV/AIDS and migration.\nContributory pension schemes (e.g. employment-based pensions) do not reach all older\npersons. Therefore, States must recognize that social pensions are critical elements for the\nprogressive realization of the right to social security for older people. Non-contributory\npensions can significantly reduce poverty and vulnerability among old people, in particular\nfor women, who live longer and are less likely to benefit from contributory systems. The\nreport provides recommendations on how to ensure that non-contributory pensions comply\nwith core human rights standards. It also addresses the role of international assistance and\ncooperation in the field of social security.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-12583 (E)\n\n010410 230410\n\n",

The report begins by\nstressing the interconnected nature of the rule of law, democracy, the principle of\nseparation of powers and the independence of the judiciary and the independence and\nimpartiality of magistrates and judges. It refers to efforts that have already been undertaken\nby organs of the international community to identify the need for continuing legal\neducation and training to enable magistrates, judges and lawyers to apply international\nhuman rights standards, norms and principles in the consideration of domestic cases.\nThe Special Rapporteur notes that, despite numerous reports, declarations and\nresolutions by international organs, there is still a considerable gap between the continuing\nhuman rights legal education offered to judges and lawyers, and the outcomes obtained\nwith regard to the application of international human rights law in specific domestic cases.\nThe Special Rapporteur considers that either capacity-building provision has been\ninsufficient, or the tools and methodology used were not the most appropriate. Whatever\nthe case, the specificities inherent to judges and lawyers, and their different levels and\ncategories, should always be considered when designing or implementing human rights\neducation programmes.\nThe report also notes that magistrates, judges, prosecutors and lawyers are faced\nwith various difficulties with regard to attending continuing education programmes: work\noverload; high cost of training courses and seminars; lack of opportunity to attend courses,\netc. The Special Rapporteur considers that if the objectives of having strong judiciaries and\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-12622 (E)\n\n270410\n\n",

The focus is on\nthose who have crossed national borders, who generally are at risk of marginalization and\nspecifically to discrimination in the provision of education. The report aims to inform and\nassist Governments and interested parties in their efforts to address these matters and\ndevelop best practices so as to ensure the enjoyment of the currently unfulfilled right to\neducation for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.\nThe report addresses six core issues, the consideration of which follows an analysis\nof the contextual background. Attention to these issues is viewed by the Special Rapporteur\nas indispensable in meeting the educational challenges and opportunities related to\nmigration. These core, but inevitably interrelated, themes are: the legal and normative\nframework; social and cultural issues; language and curriculum; teachers; accreditation;\nand learning for life.\n\n* This document is submitted late in order to include up-to-date information.\n\nGE.10-12879 (E)\n\n040510\n\n",

In addition to providing an overview of the main activities\ncarried out by the Special Rapporteur, the report focuses on the topic of reparations to\nwomen who have been subjected to violence in contexts of both peace and post-conflict.\nMost human rights and humanitarian law treaties provide for a right to a remedy. In\nthe context of gross and systematic violations of human rights, the Basic Principles and\nGuidelines on the Right to Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of\nInternational Human Rights Law and serious violations of International Humanitarian Law,\nadopted by the General Assembly in 2005, start with the premise that “the State is\nresponsible for ensuring that victims of human rights violations enjoy an individual right to\nreparation”.\nBoth the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women place upon the\nState the duty to prevent, investigate, punish and provide compensation for all acts of\nviolence wherever they occur. Article 4 of the Declaration states that women who are\nsubjected to violence should be informed about and provided with access to the\nmechanisms of justice and to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have\nsuffered, as provided by national legislation. The obligation to provide adequate reparations\ninvolves ensuring the rights of women to access both criminal and civil remedies and the\nestablishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation services for survivors of\nviolence. The notion of reparation may also include elements of restorative justice and the\nneed to address the pre-existing inequalities, injustices, prejudices and biases or other\nsocietal perceptions and practices that enabled violations to occur, including discrimination\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-13109 (E)\n\n010610\n\n",

Evidence also suggests that the additional fiscal\nspace has allowed some HIPCs to increase their public spending on essential, human rightsrelated social services, such as health care and education, thereby contributing to the\nrealization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, in these\ncountries.\nNevertheless, the voluntary nature of these debt relief measures has created\nopportunities for some commercial creditors to eschew such efforts and then attempt to\nrecover the full value of their debt through litigation. These creditors — termed “vulture\nfunds” — purchase the defaulted debt at significant discounts, hold out for other creditors\nto cancel their debts and then aggressively pursue repayments that are vastly in excess of\nthe amount that they paid for the debt. These activities not only dilute the impact of debt\nrelief by reducing the resources available to the targeted debtor countries to finance\ndevelopment and reduce poverty, they also diminish the capacity of indebted poor countries\nto create the conditions necessary for the realization of human rights, particularly\neconomic, social and cultural rights.\nThe present report, which is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council\nresolution 11/5, is intended to draw global attention to the adverse impacts of vulture fund\nactivities on debt relief and on the capacity of poor countries to fulfil their human rights\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-13156 (E)\n\n010610\n\n",

More civilians were killed or injured during this\nperiod than at any other time in the recent past.\nThe drawing of the fighting into areas populated or frequented by civilians, and\nthe use of imprecise mortars by all parties causing severe casualties and property damage\ncontinued to be a matter of serious concern. There have been persistent allegations that\nheavy retaliatory mortar fire by AMISOM troops has been responsible for many civilian\ncasualties.\nThe recruitment, training and use of children in the conflict, especially by the\narmed militants, continued unabated. While recruitment of girls has been rare and is\ngenerally regarded as socially unacceptable, there are documented accounts of girls\nworking for armed opposition groups, particularly in cooking and cleaning. Girls are also\nbrought in to transport detonators, for logistics, and intelligence collection, though they\ndo receive weapons training as well. The lack of schooling for children has made them\nespecially vulnerable for recruitment by armed groups.\nIn territories controlled by armed insurgents, many civilians do not have access to\nhumanitarian aid and they are at increasing risk of being punished under arbitrary\ninterpretations of sharia law. Journalists and civil society activists have seen their space\nfor work restricted by threats, intimidation, arbitrary arrests and killings.\n\n*\n\nGE.10-16152\n\nThe report was submitted after the deadline in order to include the most recent developments.\n\n",

Subedi\nSummary\nCambodia has made some noteworthy progress in protecting and promoting human\nrights, including enacting some major new laws to this effect. The Government of\nCambodia is more engaged with the United Nations human rights institutions and accepted\nall of the recommendations made during the universal periodic review of the country in\nDecember 2009, which include strengthening the independence and capacity of the\njudiciary. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, Cambodia remains a complex country\nin terms of the protection and promotion of human rights, as democratization has not yet\nfully taken root. Human rights violations are still taking place in a number of areas. The\nmajor areas of concern are those relating to access to land and housing rights, freedom of\nexpression, and the numerous challenges faced by the judiciary. These issues continue to\ndominate the legal and political landscape. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about\nthe narrowing of political space. The Government has to become more tolerant towards the\ninternal stakeholders and the international community in moving the country forward. The\nSpecial Rapporteur welcomes the endeavours and willingness of the Government to further\nimprove the human rights situation and strengthen the independence and capacity of the\njudiciary. He was encouraged by the openness of his government interlocutors to engage in\nsubstantive discussions, provided that issues were raised in an objective and non-partisan\nmanner, with the intention of looking for solutions. It is in this spirit that the Special\nRapporteur has made a series of recommendations in this report and encourages the\nGovernment to take the recommendations into consideration and put in place a programme\nof action with a clear timetable to implement them.\n\n∗\n\nGE.10-16145\n\nLate submission.\n\n",

It also\nidentifies several areas of continued focus for the mandate, as well as two emerging issues\nthat would need to be carefully studied from a human rights perspective.\nThe second part provides a critical analysis of the current methods of work of the\nmandate holder in order to assess to what extent the structure of the mandate is appropriate\nto enable the Special Rapporteur to carry out the functions described in Human Rights\nCouncil resolution 9/1.\nThe final part contains a set of concrete recommendations to the Human Rights\nCouncil and the new mandate holder on how to strengthen the mandate of the Special\nRapporteur in order to maximize the protection of those individuals and communities that\nmay be adversely affected by the movement and disposal of hazardous products and\nwastes.\nIn particular, the mandate holder recommends that the Council expand the mandate\nof the Special Rapporteur, so as to request him/her to monitor the adverse effects of\nhazardous products and wastes during the whole life cycle, from their production to their\ndisposal. He also suggests that the Council request the new mandate holder to develop a set\nof guidelines on human rights-based approaches to the sound management and disposal of\ntoxic and dangerous products and wastes.\n\nGE.10-14907 (E)\n\n220710\n\n",

On the basis of this testimony and other\ninformation received, the Mission was able to reconstruct a picture of the circumstances\nsurrounding the interception on 31 May 2010 and its aftermath. The report presents a\nfactual description of the events leading up to the interception, the interception of each of\nthe six ships in the flotilla as well as a seventh ship subsequently intercepted on 6 June\n2010, the deaths of nine passengers and wounding of many others and the detention of\npassengers in Israel and their deportation.\nThe report contains a legal analysis of facts as determined by the Mission with a\nview to determining whether violations of international law, including international\nhumanitarian and human rights law, took place.\nThe fact-finding mission concluded that a series of violations of international law,\nincluding international humanitarian and human rights law, were committed by the Israeli\nforces during the interception of the flotilla and during the detention of passengers in Israel\nprior to deportation.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.10-16486\n\n",

In the present report, the Working Group\nsummarizes information received during the meetings it held with Government officials\nand civil society organizations regarding the general situation of people of African descent\nin the United States and the situations that expose them to discrimination and outlines the\naction taken at various levels for their well-being. It concludes with recommendations that\nthe Working Group believes will, if implemented, make tangible improvements in the\nsituation of people of African descent in the United States.\nThe Working Group members appreciated the very informative and frank\ndiscussions they had with Government and civil society representatives and were impressed\nwith the comprehensive way in which attention to the situation of people of African descent\nis contemplated in all of the Government’s programmes to ensure the fundamental rights of\nits citizens. Although the members identified challenges still facing African Americans, the\nvarious Government representatives with whom they met accepted that, as is the case in all\nsocieties, in some areas there are still barriers to the full enjoyment of rights and efforts are\ncontinuing to correct disparities and discrimination where they are found to exist.\nDuring their visit, the members of the Working Group found that the challenges\nfaced by people of African descent in this country related mainly to disproportionately high\nlevels of unemployment, generally lower income levels than the rest of the population,\n*\n\nGE.10-15297\n\nLate submission.\n\n",

In the main report, contained in chapter III, he presents a\ncompilation of best practice in countering terrorism. The compilation is the outcome of an\nanalysis undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on the basis of his work conducted over\nalmost six years and involving various forms of interaction with multiple stakeholders. In\nparticular, he has taken into account the written submissions received from Governments\nby 30 November 2010. The full submissions are reproduced in an addendum\n(A/HRC/16/51/Add.4).\nThe outcome of the process is the identification of 10 areas of best practice. A best\npractice is distilled from existing and emerging practices in a broad range of States\nthroughout the world. The compilation also draws upon international treaties, resolutions\nadopted by international organizations and the jurisprudence of international and regional\ncourts.\nThe substance of the selected 10 areas of best practice is explained in the\ncommentary, presented separately for each practice.\nThe concept of “best practice” refers to legal and institutional frameworks that serve\nto promote and protect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in all\naspects of counter-terrorism.

However, in a context of ecological, food\nand energy crises, the most pressing issue regarding reinvestment is not how much, but\nhow. This report explores how States can and must achieve a reorientation of their\nagricultural systems towards modes of production that are highly productive, highly\nsustainable and that contribute to the progressive realization of the human right to adequate\nfood.\nDrawing on an extensive review of the scientific literature published in the last five\nyears, the Special Rapporteur identifies agroecology as a mode of agricultural development\nwhich not only shows strong conceptual connections with the right to food, but has proven\nresults for fast progress in the concretization of this human right for many vulnerable\ngroups in various countries and environments. Moreover, agroecology delivers advantages\nthat are complementary to better known conventional approaches such as breeding highyielding varieties. And it strongly contributes to the broader economic development.\nThe report argues that the scaling up of these experiences is the main challenge\ntoday. Appropriate public policies can create an enabling environment for such sustainable\nmodes of production. These policies include prioritizing the procurement of public goods in\npublic spending rather than solely providing input subsidies; investing in knowledge by\nreinvesting in agricultural research and extension services; investing in forms of social\norganization that encourage partnerships, including farmer field schools and farmers’\nmovements innovation networks; investing in agricultural research and extension systems;\nempowering women; and creating a macro-economic enabling environment, including\nconnecting sustainable farms to fair markets.\n\nGE.10-17849\n\n",

Since her previous report, the independent expert has undertaken\ntwo official country missions, to Colombia and to Viet Nam, to consult on minority issues.\nThe independent expert has continued her work to promote implementation of the\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and\nLinguistic Minorities. She has conducted extensive consultations with regard to all\nelements of her mandate. She has attended expert seminars and conferences, convened\nconsultations, engaged with States, specialized agencies, bodies and mechanisms of the\nUnited Nations system and regional intergovernmental organizations. She has consulted\nwidely with civil society and directly with minority communities. She has guided and\nprepared the annual sessions of the Forum on Minority Issues, which in 2010 considered\n“Minorities and effective participation in economic life”. The independent expert reported\nto the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nIn the present report, the independent expert focuses on the role of the protection of\nminority rights in conflict prevention. She emphasizes that, among the essential elements of\na strategy to prevent conflicts involving minorities are respect for minority rights,\nparticularly with regard to equality in access to economic and social opportunities; effective\nparticipation of minorities in decision-making; dialogue between minorities and majorities\nwithin societies; and the constructive development of practices and institutional\narrangements to accommodate diversity within society. Attention to minority rights at an\nearly stage — before grievances lead to tensions and violence — would make an invaluable\ncontribution to the culture of prevention within the United Nations, save countless lives and\npromote stability and development. Among a series of recommendations is that expertise in\nminority rights should be strengthened and integrated comprehensively across the United\nNations system.\n\nGE.10-17814\n\n",

There have been very significant\npolitical developments since the report submitted by my predecessor last year, including the\nelection of a Constituent Assembly, the declaration of a Republic and the formation of a new\nGovernment, as well as legislative and institutional reforms aimed at strengthening human rights\nprotection. Challenges remain with regard to addressing the root causes of the conflict, which\ninclude impunity and deep-seated inequalities and discrimination. Priorities must also include\nimproving public security and the protection of the population’s rights to life, liberty and security\nwhich are threatened by the proliferation of armed groups operating in the Terai (plains).\nThe report highlights the need for all parties to the peace process to translate their public\ncommitments into concrete actions to bring about lasting improvements in the human rights\nsituation, including by ensuring that human rights and fundamental freedoms for all are\nenshrined in the future Constitution of Nepal. Durable improvements in the human rights\nsituation and the strengthening of national institutions will require sustained efforts over an\nextended period, through concerted cooperation and dialogue among all relevant actors. OHCHR\nNepal is ready to continue supporting the Government and people of Nepal in this endeavour.\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.09-11609 (E) 110309\n\n",

In particular, the report explains that the independent expert intends to\ntake a thematic approach to her mandate, focusing on different themes each year, with the first\nyear concentrated on sanitation. She provides a brief overview of the problem of lack of access\nto sanitation, and its connection to other human rights violations. She announces her hope to hold\ntwo consultations in 2009, one focused on elaborating the normative content of human rights\nobligations related to access to sanitation, and one focused on developing criteria by which to\nidentify good practices with regard to the human rights obligations related to water and\nsanitation.

Development cooperation and food aid increasingly form a\ncontinuum ranging from interventions aimed at providing long-term support for food security to\nshort-term answers to emergency situations. Both these policies have been under increased\nscrutiny in recent years, and both are in need of reform. This report makes a number of\nsuggestions on how to reorient them by better integrating a perspective grounded in the human\nright to adequate food at three levels: in the definition of the obligations of donor States; in the\nidentification of the tools on which these policies rely; and in the evaluation of such policies,\nwith a view to their continuous improvement. At its core, a human rights approach turns what\nhas been a bilateral relationship between donor and partner, into a triangular relationship, in\nwhich the ultimate beneficiaries of these policies play an active role. Seeing the provision of\nforeign aid as a means to fulfil the human right to adequate food has concrete implications,\nwhich assume that donor and partner Governments are duty-bearers, and beneficiaries are\nrights-holders.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.09-10764 (E) 160209\n\n",

These early warning signs\nrelate to action, or inaction, by State actors, non-State actors and international or external\nfactors.\nThe Special Rapporteur also provides an overview of some general patterns and\nissues of concern related to her mandate. In this regard, she distinguishes between\ndiscrimination and violence on the grounds of religion or belief (i.e. based on the religious\naffiliation of the victim) and discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief\n(i.e. based on or arrogated to religious tenets of the perpetrator).\nIn her conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that\nprevention is key for creating an atmosphere of religious tolerance. The structure of the\nState, its method of governance, educational policies and the commitment of Governments\nand societies to fundamental human rights are the central ingredients that can act as\nprecautionary factors in creating religious harmony or contributing factors to religious\nfriction. The Special Rapporteur identifies some appropriate responses by various actors,\nincluding recommendations with regard to the role of the State, the role of religious leaders\nand civil society, and the role of the international community and human rights\nmechanisms. She stresses that States have the primary responsibility for implementing\ninternational human rights standards, including freedom of religion or belief. Politicians\nfrom different political parties should undertake brainstorming sessions on how to address\nnew challenges in an increasingly globalized world. Religious leaders and civil society as a\nwhole may also play an important role in supporting and encouraging religious tolerance.\nEmerging tensions in a given society may be defused, for example, if religious leaders\n\nGE.09-17648 (E)\n\n140110\n\n",

The main report, contained in chapter II, highlights\nseveral concerns of the Special Rapporteur regarding the protection of the right to privacy\nin the fight against terrorism. The importance of the right to privacy and data protection is\nhighlighted in section A.\nArticle 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is flexible\nenough to enable necessary, legitimate and proportionate restrictions to the right to privacy.\nThe Special Rapporteur argues, in section B, that article 17 should be interpreted as\ncontaining elements of a permissible limitations test. In this context, he calls upon States to\njustify why a particular aim is legitimate justification for restrictions upon article 17, and\nupon the Human Rights Committee to adopt a new general comment on article 17.\nThe Special Rapporteur highlights the erosion of the right to privacy in the fight\nagainst terrorism in section C. This erosion takes place through the use of surveillance\npowers and new technologies, which are used without adequate legal safeguards. States\nhave endangered the protection of the right to privacy by not extending pre-existing\nsafeguards in their cooperation with third countries and private actors. These measures have\nnot only led to violations of the right to privacy, but also have an impact on due process\nrights and the freedom of movement — especially at borders — and can have a chilling\neffect on the freedom of association and the freedom of expression.\nWithout a rigorous set of legal safeguards and a means to measure the necessity,\nproportionality and reasonableness of the interference, States have no guidance on\nminimizing the risks to privacy generated by their new policies. The Special Rapporteur\nhas identified, in section D, some of the legal safeguards that have emerged through\npolicymaking, jurisprudence, policy reviews and good practice from around the world.\n\nGE.09-17804 (E)\n\n270110\n\n",

It\nemphasizes that States have an obligation to implement fully the principle of nondiscrimination, in particular when deciding on issues relating to the acquisition and\nretention of a nationality. It also recalls the general obligation of States to prevent\nstatelessness.

These actors play a key role, as they connect producers\nto consumers, and as they transform raw commodities into edible food. But the vast\nmajority of those who are hungry in the world today are part of the food system; small\nindependent food producers or waged agricultural workers working on farms in the formal\nor informal sector represent over half of the billion who go hungry today. The report\ntherefore asks how the sourcing, pricing, and wages policies of commodity buyers, food\nprocessors and retailers impact the right to food. The report seeks to contribute to a better\nunderstanding, by agribusiness corporations and States alike, of their respective\nresponsibilities and obligations under international law. It ends with 10 recommendations\nto States and the agribusiness sector to ensure that the current transformation of the food\nchain will contribute to the realization of the right to food. The recommendations relate to a\nrange of areas, including codes of conduct and international framework agreements,\ncooperatives, marketing boards, public procurement, and competition law.\n\nGE.09-17776 (E)\n\n280110\n\n",

In particular, there are concerns at the lack of\npolitical will to end impunity for past and ongoing human rights abuses by the State and the\nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN(M)), insufficient action to address discrimination and,\nagainst a backdrop of increased violence by armed groups in the plains, to address the State’s\nobligation to protect the rights of the population to life, liberty and security.

In particular, he reiterates that\nextreme poverty should be regarded as the combination of income poverty, human development\npoverty and social exclusion. The independent expert calls for attention to be focused on the\nintersection of these three components of poverty when social consensus on poverty reduction\nstrategies are formulated. On this basis, he notes that European Union policies are based on the\nsame conceptual understanding of poverty as that proposed by the independent expert. In this\ncontext, European Union programmes promoting social inclusion are discussed. In the report, the\nindependent expert emphasizes the importance of international cooperation, which is enshrined\nin international human rights law. In order to examine the effectiveness of international\ncooperation in eradicating extreme poverty, the independent expert makes some observations on\nthe past experiences on poverty reduction strategy papers in Africa. He concludes the report by\nemphasizing the need to recognize that extreme poverty is a denial of human rights, and suggests\nthat guiding principles on extreme poverty become legally binding.\n\n* The present report is submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most relevant\ninformation.\n\nGE.08-11156 (E) 050308\n\n",

The concept of “sphere of influence” is\nconsidered too broad and ambiguous a concept to define the scope of due diligence required to\nfulfil the responsibility to respect, and the Special Representative sets out an alternative\napproach. In contrast, avoiding complicity is viewed as an essential ingredient in the due\ndiligence carried out to respect rights because it describes a subset of the indirect ways in which\ncompanies can have an adverse effect on rights through their relationships.\n\n* This document is submitted late to reflect the most recent information.\n\nGE.08-13478 (E) 220508\n\n",

The present report to the Council accordingly addresses recent developments in\nrespect of conscientious objection to military service and is updating in character.\n2.\nAn important development since the previous comprehensive report in February 2006 on\nconscientious objection to military service concerns a decision on the merits by the Human\nRights Committee, taken in 2006 in communications nos. 1321/2004 and 1322/2004 at the\nCommittee’s eighty-eighth session, held from 16 October to 3 November 2006.

More than 4,000 cases of human rights violations were committed in\nthe first half of 2008 by law enforcement and administration of provinces. Most violations\nregistered related to cases of ill-treatment, rape, torture of suspects by police officials and\nviolations of due process by police and judicial officials. These issues are taken to the officials in\ncharge in the Government by the Human Rights and Justice Section of the United Nations\nIntegrated Office in Burundi (BINUB) in the context of its monitoring activities.\n\n* Late submission.\n\nGE.08-15085 (E) 200808\n\n",

James Anaya*\nSummary\nThe present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 6/12,\nand is the first report of Professor S. James Anaya in his capacity as Special Rapporteur on the\nsituation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. The resolution\nrequires the Special Rapporteur, inter alia, to promote the United Nations Declaration on the\nRights of Indigenous Peoples and other international instruments relevant to the advancement of\nthe rights of indigenous peoples. On this basis, the Special Rapporteur provides an analysis of\nthe Declaration, in the context of other international instruments specifically regarding\nindigenous peoples and human rights instruments of general applicability. Reflecting the\ncommon international body of opinion regarding the rights of indigenous peoples, the\nDeclaration elaborates on general human standards as they apply to the specific context of\nindigenous peoples, with a particular emphasis on the remedial measures required to address the\nhistorical contemporary denial of their rights. The last section of the report analyses the different\nmeasures required to implement and make operative the rights affirmed in the Declaration, a\nprocess which involves a joint effort by States, the United Nations system, indigenous peoples\nand relevant civil society actors.\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline due to the tight time frame between the\nappointment of the Special Rapporteur and the deadline for the submission of the report.\n\nGE.08-14940 (E) 200808\n\n",

Consequently, the report\nprovides a presentation of some of the principal elements of the Convention.

Corruption affects in particular the poor, marginalized and vulnerable\nsegments of society; it is not only a problem of criminal behaviour, but also and above\nall a structural issue. Combating corruption therefore requires a coherent, holistic\napproach that seeks to prevent and suppress corrupt behaviour. International human\nrights law and international anti-corruption law share the same principles of integrity,\ntransparency, accountability and participation, which are also key principles of good\ngovernance. The United Nations Convention against Corruption and the findings of its\nImplementation Review Mechanism constitute the most widely agreed international\nstandard for addressing structural impediments.\n\nGE.19-06681(E)\n\n\n\n",

In the report the\nSecretary-General highlights several significant initiatives that Member States across the\nglobe have taken that contribute to meeting those objectives. He particularly emphasizes\nthe role of education as the most important tool for building the resilience of societies\nagainst violence, noting that education can foster a culture of prevention, reduce prejudices,\npromote peaceful coexistence and diversity and cultivate respect for all peoples. The\nSecretary-General also identifies existing opportunities within the United Nations system to\nmake atrocity prevention more effective. In this regard, he encourages Member States to\ncooperate with the human rights mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, to develop\nplans, policies and strategies to address long-term risks and to mobilize international\nsupport for national initiatives to address those risks. More broadly, the Secretary-General\nrecommends that States continue to make their own national efforts to prevent atrocities,\nwithin their own borders, while also participating in regional and international efforts to\nassist other States in fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\n* The present report was submitted late to Conference Services as a result of administrative constraints.\nGE.19-17261(E)\n\n\n\n",

Taking into account the opportunities for advancing human rights\nprovided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the reform process of the\nUnited Nations, in the report the universal periodic review is considered as a key entry\npoint for integrating human rights into development efforts while enhancing cooperative\nendeavours at the national level by Member States, the United Nations and the wider\ninternational community on the implementation of recommendations from all human rights\nmechanisms. The support provided by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for national mechanisms for reporting and\nfollow-up, for national human rights action plans and in integrating human rights into the\nSustainable Development Goals is reviewed. The role of regional mechanisms and\ntechnical cooperation is analysed, as are ways in which assistance by the United Nations\nsystem can be better mobilized to meet national needs, including through more effective\nuse of existing official development assistance (ODA), thus reinforcing national human\nrights protection systems, while enhancing national ownership and the effectiveness of aid.\n\nGE.19-06909(E)\n\n\n\n",

Many changes have taken place since\nthen, including the election of Félix Tshisekedi as President of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo on 30 December 2018, which marked the start of a transition that is still under\nway. In addition, Kasai has faced an influx of several hundred thousand people who have\nbeen forced to leave neighbouring Angola.\nIn order to resolve the crisis, the team of international experts recommends stepping\nup efforts to combat impunity in Kasai by introducing a more focused prosecution policy\nthat targets specific types of offence and a particular range of groups in such a way as to\nencompass all the international crimes that have been committed in Kasai, the scale and\ngravity of which are undeniable. It is urgently necessary to strengthen national prosecution\nand trial capacities so as to be able to reduce the international presence. A prosecution\npolicy of this kind would be a chance to take advantage of the window of opportunity for\npeace and reconciliation that remains open in Kasai. It must be combined with the urgent\nintroduction of a policy aimed at reconciling communities, disarming and integrating\nmembers of all militia groups and reducing the military presence in Kasai, and the\nestablishment of a transitional justice mechanism that is culturally and legally appropriate.\nThis transitional justice mechanism must involve searching for the root causes of the\nconflict, establishing the truth and providing redress, identifying the reforms that are\nneeded and creating a culture of peace, dialogue and tolerance.\nLastly, the economic and social causes of the current crisis, which has particularly\naffected young persons and women, require the rapid implementation of a policy for the\nreconstruction and development of Kasai, accompanied by the injection of specially\ndedicated funds.\n\nGE.19-07485 (E)\n\n280519 290519\n\n\n\n",

Kyrgyzstan is in a good position to continue to strengthen its healthrelated policies and services; if it is to retain that position, however, a human rights-based\nand modern approach to public health will be needed. In a context where there is strong\npolitical will, solid policy developments and good pilot practices, the main challenge facing\nthe full realization of the right to physical and mental health in Kyrgyzstan will be effective\nimplementation and sustainability. This challenge is linked to the promotion of\ntransparency and the need to address corrupt and ineffective practices that persist. To do so,\nthe Government should develop a long-term strategy and take ownership of the\nprogrammes developed with international cooperation, ensuring their continuation and\nsustainability with the investment of national resources. Specific challenges that remain\ninclude the enjoyment of different sexual and reproductive health rights, discriminatory\npractices in health-care services, and the need to progressively deinstitutionalize mental\nhealth and social welfare services.

While the public health system includes many elements\ncompatible with the right to health, a human rights-based approach is still needed for the\nState comprehensively to comply with its obligations to protect, respect and fulfil the right\nto health.

Such\nsurveillance has thrived amid weak controls on exports and transfers of technology to\nGovernments with well-known policies of repression. In the present report, the Special\nRapporteur begins by identifying the problem of targeted surveillance seen from the\nobligations that human rights law imposes on States and the related responsibilities of\ncompanies. He then proposes a legal and policy framework for regulation, accountability\nand transparency within the private surveillance industry. He concludes with a call for\ntighter regulation of surveillance exports and restrictions on their use, as well as a call for\nan immediate moratorium on the global sale and transfer of the tools of the private\nsurveillance industry until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate\nsuch practices and guarantee that Governments and non-State actors use the tools in\nlegitimate ways.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent information.\nGE.19-08652(E)\n\n\n\n",

Depending on their nature and aims, private actors may\ncontribute to the realization of the right to education and offer educational alternatives, thus\nenhancing, for example, respect for cultural diversity. However, the persistent\nunderfunding of public education and the rapid and unregulated growth in the involvement\nof private, in particular commercial, actors in education, threaten the implementation of the\nright to education for all and Sustainable Development Goal 4.\nThe report contains observations and recommendations on the obligation of States to\nfund and provide public education and provides some concrete suggestions and solutions.

In the report, the Special\nRapporteur takes note of the multiple internal and external challenges faced by the Niger in\nthe management of migration and observes that, in recent years, it has adopted a series of\nmeasures led primarily by security concerns and as a result of agreements with destination\ncountries. These measures have led to the criminalization of irregular migration and the\nstrengthening of border control to curb and prevent migration to the north, in violation of\nthe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) principle of freedom of\nmovement as well as international human rights norms and standards, including in the\ncontext of readmission agreements and the return of migrants to their countries of origin.\nAmong his recommendations, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Niger to adopt a\ncomprehensive strategy for safe, orderly and regular migration that ensures implementation\nof the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the 2030 Agenda for\nSustainable Development and that places the human rights of migrants at its centre. In that\nprocess, collaboration with key actors, such as neighbouring countries, ECOWAS, the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations, will be essential.\n\n* The summary of the present report is being circulated in all official languages.

Even\nunder the best-case scenario, hundreds of millions will face food insecurity, forced\nmigration, disease and death. Climate change threatens the future of human rights and risks\nundoing the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction.\nStaying the course will be disastrous for the global economy and pull vast numbers\ninto poverty. Addressing climate change will require a fundamental shift in the global\neconomy, decoupling improvements in economic well-being from fossil fuel emissions. It\nis imperative that this is done in a way that provides necessary support, protects workers\nand creates decent work.\nGovernments and too many in the human rights community have failed to seriously\naddress climate change for decades. Sombre speeches by government officials have not led\nto meaningful action and too many countries continue taking short-sighted steps in the\nwrong direction. States are paying only marginal attention to human rights in the\nconversation on climate change.\nAlthough climate change has been on the human rights agenda for well over a\ndecade, it remains a marginal concern for most actors. However, it represents an emergency\nwithout precedent and requires bold and creative thinking from the human rights\ncommunity and a radically more robust, detailed and coordinated approach.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent developments.\nGE.19-12191(E)\n\n\n\n",

Policies of austerity introduced in 2010 continue largely unabated,\ndespite the tragic social consequences. Close to 40 per cent of children are predicted to be\nliving in poverty by 2021. Food banks have proliferated; homelessness and rough sleeping\nhave increased greatly; tens of thousands of poor families must live in accommodation far\nfrom their schools, jobs and community networks; life expectancy is falling for certain\ngroups; and the legal aid system has been decimated.\nThe social safety net has been badly damaged by drastic cuts to local authorities’\nbudgets, which have eliminated many social services, reduced policing services, closed\nlibraries in record numbers, shrunk community and youth centres and sold off public spaces\nand buildings. The bottom line is that much of the glue that has held British society\ntogether since the Second World War has been deliberately removed and replaced with a\nharsh and uncaring ethos. A booming economy, high employment and a budget surplus\nhave not reversed austerity, a policy pursued more as an ideological than an economic\nagenda.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Poverty levels have diminished significantly, but high\nlevels of growth driven by the exploitation of natural resources and foreign investment have\nnot translated into commensurate reductions in poverty. Eighty per cent of the population\nstill lives on less than $2.50 per day. Inequality is rising, as urban elites prosper, and many\nlower-income people have been deprived of their land and access to vital natural resources.\nThe Lao People’s Revolutionary Party holds a monopoly over the political system, and\npolitical freedoms are largely non-existent. The present report should be read in\nconjunction with the Special Rapporteur’s end of mission statement, which contains a\ndetailed assessment of those issues and of the particular challenges that arise for people in\nrural areas, women and ethnic minority groups.\nThe present report focuses on initiatives and reforms that the Lao People’s\nDemocratic Republic can undertake to support people in poverty and enhance respect for\ntheir human rights. They include re-evaluating economic growth strategies to ensure that\nthe benefits of growth are shared more equally, investing in a strong social protection\nsystem, which is currently largely absent, and adopting policies of transparency,\nmeaningful participation by, and empowerment of, people in poverty and engaging in\ngenuine public dialogue.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

It also provides an overview of global and national level\nactivities implemented in accordance with this Plan of Action by State actors, UN agencies,\ncivil society and others.\nThe thematic priorities for GP20 were determined at a stakeholder meeting convened\nin September 2017 in Geneva by the Special Rapporteur. A GP20 Plan of Action 1 was\ndeveloped around four priority areas (participation of IDPs; national laws and policies\naddressing internal displacement; data and analysis on internal displacement; and addressing\nprotracted displacement and facilitating durable solutions) through consultations with UN\nMember States, UN entities, NGOs, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement\nand key experts on internal displacement. The Plan of Action was launched on 17 April 2018\nin Geneva at a meeting convened by the Special Rapporteur and hosted by Austria, Honduras\nand Uganda. A Communications Working Group was likewise established to support the\nPlan of Action.

However, additional efforts should be made in order to\ntranslate the policy commitment into reality, including by establishing enforcement\nmechanisms for the effective implementation of State obligations and business\nresponsibilities to prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse business-related human rights\nimpacts.\nThe Government should also take additional steps to systematically embed respect\nfor human rights in all its activities as an economic actor, and set clear expectations for\ncompanies to respect human rights by conducting proper human rights due diligence\nprocesses. Obstacles remain for victims of human rights abuses to gain access to an\neffective remedy, and mechanisms should be aimed at strengthening accountability,\nincluding through the creation of grievance mechanisms at the operational level.\nEqual and meaningful participation of all stakeholders, particularly affected\ncommunity members and human rights defenders, remains a challenge. More efforts should\nbe made to ensure access to information and technical assistance for rights holders in\nrelation to all business-related questions that may have an impact on them.

Mindful of this shortcoming, the Special Rapporteur argues in\nthe present report that social inclusion of victims and survivors of trafficking in persons\nis a State obligation that stems from the due diligence standard and the right to effective\nremedy.\nThe Special Rapporteur also identifies key challenges related to long-term social\ninclusion, and highlights some promising practices that are innovative and\ntransformative, which should be replicated, funded and implemented on a larger scale,\nby States, civil society organizations and the international community.\n\nGE.19-06537(E)\n\n\n\n",

In her report, she\ncommends the comprehensive anti-trafficking legislative and institutional framework and\nadvocates for better enforcement and increased funding to its specialized agency for\ncombating trafficking in order to achieve better results regarding the identification of and\nsupport for trafficked persons.\nThe Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of 10 government shelters for\nvictims of trafficking but is deeply concerned about their “closed” nature, which infringes\nthe human rights of victims and survivors. She therefore recommends that the policy be\nurgently reviewed. She also welcomes the establishment of the Edo State task force against\nhuman trafficking, commends the work of civil society organizations and advocates for a\ndedicated government fund to finance their projects. She emphasizes that, especially in the\ncontext of forced or voluntary returns, long-term measures aimed at social inclusion are\nneeded to provide survivors with viable alternatives and prevent retrafficking. Prevention\nmeasures solely aimed at raising awareness of the risks of migration have proven\nineffective and should be coupled with meaningful economic empowerment measures, such\nas job creation, business skills training and extensive tutorship during the start-up phase of\na business.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

While judges and prosecutors enjoy the fundamental\nrights and freedoms enshrined in human rights instruments, as public officials, they have\nspecial duties and responsibilities that justify the introduction of specific restrictions on\ntheir fundamental freedoms. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between the rights\nof judges and prosecutors and the legitimate interest of the national authorities in protecting\nthe independence, impartiality and authority of their institutions.\nThroughout the report, the Special Rapporteur documents various forms of\ninterference with the exercise of fundamental freedoms by judges and prosecutors. Not all\ndisciplinary measures adopted against judges and prosecutors in these cases can be\nregarded as being necessary in a democratic society to maintain public trust in the judiciary\nor the public prosecution. In some cases, these sanctions appear to be an expedient to\npunish the individual judge or prosecutor for the opinions expressed or the action taken in\nthe exercise of his or her duties. In others, the severity of the sanction also has a “chilling\neffect” on other members of the judiciary or public prosecution, who may be discouraged\nfrom expressing critical views out of fear of being subjected to punitive measures.\nIn the light of the existing international and regional standards and the jurisprudence\nof regional courts and mechanisms, the Special Rapporteur offers some recommendations\nto State authorities on how to strike a fair balance between the fundamental rights of\nindividual judges and prosecutors and the legitimate interests of the State. The\nrecommendations also provide guidance to individual judges and prosecutors on how to\nexercise their fundamental freedoms in a way that is consistent with the dignity of their\nprofession and the independence and impartiality of their office.\n\n* The annex is being circulated in the language of submission only.\nGE.19-06912(E)\n\n\n\n",

The title of the 2018 Forum was\n“Business respect for human rights – building on what works”. The main focus was the\nsecond pillar of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – the corporate\nresponsibility to respect human rights – and, in particular, the requirement that companies\nexercise human rights due diligence to prevent adverse impacts on people. The programme\nincluded more than 70 different sessions and gathered more than 2,700 participants from a\nrange of backgrounds, including States, business, civil society, international organizations\nand affected groups and individuals.\nOwing to the large number of sessions held during the Forum, the report does not\nprovide a detailed summary, but rather a broad overview and key messages emerging from\nthe discussions that took place over the three days. It should be read together with the\nprogramme, session concept notes, statements and session web recordings of the Forum,\nwhich are available on the Forum website (www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/\nForum/Pages/2018ForumBHR.aspx).\n\nGE.19-07108(E)\n\n\n\n",

She has monitored the human rights situation in the\ncountry by conducting field missions to other countries and by engaging with a broad range\nof stakeholders. While the Special Rapporteur welcomed the opportunity to meet with the\ndelegation of Eritrea in the margins of the fortieth session of the Human Rights Council in\nMarch 2019, she notes that the Government remains opposed to cooperating with her\nmandate on substantive issues and to granting her access to the country.\nSince the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and Ethiopia\nwas signed in July 2018, the two countries have continued to make progress towards\nachieving sustainable peace. Eritrea has also improved its relations with its neighbours in\nthe region, engaged in efforts to promote integration and economic ties in East Africa and\nshown an increased willingness to normalize bilateral relations with various countries. In\nNovember 2018, the Security Council lifted its sanctions against Eritrea.\nThe positive momentum for peace and security in the region has raised expectations\nin Eritrea and in the international community that the Government of Eritrea will\nimplement political and institutional reforms. However, the Eritrean authorities have not\nyet engaged in a process of domestic reforms and the human rights situation remains\nunchanged. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur identifies key areas that remain\nunaddressed and sets out benchmarks for achieving meaningful and lasting progress in\nhuman rights.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.19-08042(E)\n\n\n\n",

She explains why the racial equality and non-discrimination\nobligations enshrined in the international human rights framework must be central to\nreform, regulation and evaluation of the extractivism economy. She develops (a) a\nstructural racial equality analysis at a global level that highlights the racially subordinating\neffects of unequal distribution of power among States and between such States and\ntransnational corporations; and (b) a more localized racial equality analysis at the national\nlevel that underlines the racially discriminatory human rights violations experienced by\ncommunities living directly on or close to territories of extraction. Finally, she formulates\nrecommendations addressed to all stakeholders to ensure human rights protection in the\nextractivism economy, especially in tackling global structural racial inequality, which is\nrooted in persisting sovereign inequality.\n\n* The present report was submitted late to reflect the most recent information received in response to a\ncall for submissions by the Special Rapporteur.\n\nGE.19-07856(E)\n\n\n\n",

She notes\nthat the United Kingdom has shown some leadership in key areas for the achievement of\nracial equality, especially with regards to the Race Disparity Audit and the legislative\nframework that prohibits racial discrimination and intolerance. Nevertheless, the Special\nRapporteur highlights that important work remains to be done to address structural forms of\nracial discrimination and inequality.

The opening up of democratic space observed\nfollowing the elections, including the release of several political prisoners and prisoners of\nconscience, is encouraging, but further efforts are needed to ensure the full exercise of\nfundamental freedoms. The High Commissioner finds it regrettable that, even though the\ntwo joint commissions set up to investigate the violations committed during protests that\ntook place between 2016 and 2018 published reports in June 2018, no judicial action has\nbeen taken with regard to the violations documented.\nThe High Commissioner remains concerned about the situation in conflict-affected\nareas, where the defence and security forces and armed groups have continued to commit a\nlarge number of human rights violations and abuses, including sexual violence. The\nupsurge in intercommunal conflict and violence against certain ethnic groups is also\nworrying.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.19-13875 (E)\n\n040919\n\n\n\n060919\n\n",

The vast majority of the population shares\nindigenous values and spiritual beliefs which are reflected in strong local institutions, the\ncustomary justice system and communal land management. Indigenous practices have\ntranslated into important gains in environmental protection and biodiversity that can serve\nas inspiring examples for other countries.

It also\ntransmitted 75 urgent appeals to 34 Governments concerning 117 identified individuals and\n94 letters of allegations and other letters to 52 Governments. States informed the Working\nGroup that they had taken measures to remedy the situations of detainees and, in an\nincreasing number of cases, the detainees were released. The Working Group is grateful to\nthose Governments that responded to its appeals and took steps to provide it with the\ninformation requested on the situation of detainees.\nThe Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it visited, in\nparticular in connection with its recommendations. The Working Group undertook a\nfollow-up visit to Hungary. The visit, scheduled to take place from 12 to 16 November\n2018, was suspended. The Working Group also conducted a country visit to Bhutan from\n14 to 24 January 2019.\nIn the present report, the Working Group examines the following thematic issues:\n(a) deprivation of liberty in the context of conscientious objection to military service; (b)\nuse of registers to avoid arbitrary detention; (c) use of the Working Group’s opinions in\ndomestic proceedings; and (d) comprehensive reparations to victims of arbitrary detention.\nIn its recommendations, the Working Group calls for increased cooperation from\nStates, especially in relation to its requests for country visits, in relation to their responses\nto urgent appeals and communications and for the implementation of its opinions.\nFurthermore, the Working Group urges Member States to provide adequate and predictable\nhuman resources in order to allow it to fulfil its mandate in an effective and sustainable\nmanner.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent developments.\nGE.19-12083(E)\n\n\n\n",

The Working Group commends the progress made by\nBhutan in relation to the deprivation of liberty since its visits in 1994 and 1996, including\nthe regular observance of the requirement to present an individual before a judge within the\n24-hour time limit, the use of open-air prisons, the growth of civil society and the legal\nprofession, improvements with regard to juvenile justice, expeditious trials and the consistent\nuse of custody registers. At the same time, the Working Group identifies important\nchallenges in the criminal justice system with regard to preventing arbitrary detention, such\nas the existence of non-bailable offences, the absence of dedicated pretrial detention facilities\nfor adults, the detention of juveniles in police stations, a lack of attention to the needs of\nfemale detainees, failures in guaranteeing legal representation, a low level of legal literacy\nand awareness, the practice of deprivation of liberty due to debt and the fact that the time\npersons are held in police stations – the only facilities for holding pretrial detainees in Bhutan\n– is not counted towards the remission of sentences. The Working Group also identifies\nissues of concern in the context of drug-related detention, including a lack of judicial control\nof drug testing, an arbitrary distinction between individuals eligible for rehabilitation and\nthose who will be detained and the impossibility of challenging the findings of the treatment\nassessment panel that makes such decisions. Among its recommendations to address issues\nidentified during the visit, the Working Group encourages Bhutan to become a party to the\nmajor human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, and to adopt legislative amendments and specific practices that offer greater\nprotection against arbitrary detention.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\n** The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

It also recalls that enforced disappearances are\nprohibited under any circumstance, including a state of war or any other public emergency.2\nThis prohibition is non-derogable and must be also respected by the de facto authorities in\nDonetsk and Luhansk.\nThe pain and anguish of relatives of disappeared persons cannot be used for political\npurposes. Decisive measures must be taken to assist family members who are looking for\ntheir disappeared loved ones, to provide them with reparation – including psychosocial,\neconomical and other support – and to bring perpetrators to justice.

As a result,\npotential violations of human rights occur frequently and disproportionately impact persons\nthat live in vulnerable situations, such as the homeless. In such cases, the violations of the\nrights to water and sanitation determine the violation of several other related rights. The\nfailure of States to include access to water and sanitation in public spaces and in other\nspheres of life beyond the household within their policy and planning is also inconsistent\nwith the commitment they have made to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGE.19-11760(E)\n\n\n\n",

During his visit,\nthe Special Rapporteur found that the lack of adequate water and sanitation services\nconstituted an additional key layer of vulnerability in addition to existing vulnerabilities,\nsuch as poverty, unemployment, a high degree of inequality and the prevalence of\nHIV/AIDS and orphaned children. Throughout the report, he illustrates his findings based\non the normative content of the human rights to water and sanitation (availability,\naccessibility, quality, affordability and acceptability) and provides guidelines for the\nGovernment of Lesotho to take action to improve the situation. In conclusion, the Special\nRapporteur emphasizes that the adoption of a comprehensive approach to implementing the\nhuman rights to water and sanitation will guide Lesotho to focus on the most vulnerable\npopulations and to “leave no one behind”, in accordance with its commitment to the 2030\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

However, when the situation is\nobserved from a human rights perspective, it is of great concern that some groups still do\nnot enjoy their human rights to water and sanitation. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes\nthat a human rights-based approach to resolving such issues should prioritize and focus on\nthose who are socially and economically marginalized, such as: (a) the Orang Asli\nindigenous peoples; (b) those living in rural areas; (c) those affected by megaprojects; (d)\nthose living in informal settlements; (e) undocumented children in alternative educational\nfacilities; (f) refugees and asylum seekers; (g) prisoners and detainees; and (h) transgender\nand gender non-conforming persons. To address disparities in access to water and\nsanitation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Malaysia\nincorporate human rights into its continued efforts to improve water and sanitation services\nfor all and to “leave no one behind”.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Syrian\nwomen, men and children in the east of the country, for example, witnessed large-scale\noperations by the international coalition led by the United States of America, and the\nSyrian Democratic Forces, which led to near complete destruction of towns and villages\nin and around Hajin and Baghuz (Dayr al-Zawr). Waves of displacements from these\nareas ensued, in which tens of thousands of fleeing civilians were taken to makeshift\nsettlements, including Al-Hol camp, straining the already severely overstretched\nhumanitarian resources.\nMeanwhile, beginning in February, aerial and ground offensives by progovernment forces to oust Levant Liberation Organization (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham)\nterrorists and affiliated armed groups from Idlib, northern Hama, Ladhiqiyah and\nwestern Aleppo escalated dramatically, destroying infrastructure essential to the survival\nof the civilian population, including hospitals, markets, educational facilities and\nagricultural resources, and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.\nIn areas controlled by the Government, civilians, including recent returnees, were\narbitrarily arrested and detained. Service provision in Dar‘a and Duma, eastern Ghutah\n(Rif Dimashq) is, moreover, ineffective, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of\nadequate access to water, electricity and education.\nIn order to mitigate the most urgent protection gaps, the Commission proposes a\nseries of pragmatic recommendations to Member States and, in particular, to those that\nprovide support to the warring parties. The international community as a whole bears a\nshared responsibility for the myriad crimes committed against millions of Syrian women,\nmen and children.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\n** The annexes to the present report are circulated as received, in the language of submission only.\nGE.19-13938(E)\n\n\n\n",

It also took a comprehensive look at the varied\nintersections of big data and racial justice (and injustice).

It\nconcluded that mapping and analysis of disaggregated data were crucial to inform policy\npriorities relating to equality and opportunity for people of African descent. In addition, the\nrefusal by some States to collect and disaggregate data based on race and ethnicity was one\nof the most serious impediments to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals,\nand achieving those Goals and meeting their targets required dismantling the structural and\nsystemic barriers to sustainable development that exist for people of African descent in\ndeveloping and developed countries.

It describes general trends in the human rights situation in the Central African\nRepublic and the major developments affecting it.\nThe reporting period was marked by an intensification of the peace talks, which led\nto the adoption, on 6 February 2019, of the Political Agreement for Peace and\nReconciliation in the Central African Republic between the Central African Government\nand 14 armed groups. The agreement, signed in Bangui, was the result of the negotiations\nheld in Khartoum from 24 January to 5 February 2019, in the framework of the African\nInitiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic, launched by the\nAfrican Union.\nAs to developments in the human rights situation, the number of violations remained\nhigh until the end of 2018 and then fell sharply in the first half of 2019.\nThis decrease is attributable in part to the absence of major confrontations between\nrival armed groups or attacks on the civilian population, and to the signing of the Peace\nAgreement on 6 February 2019 in Bangui. However, an attack by members of the armed\ngroup Retour, réclamation et réhabilitation (Return, Reclamation and Rehabilitation), one\nof the signatories to the Agreement, was a setback in this trend towards improvement.\nThe Independent Expert wishes to emphasize that the peace process will succeed\nonly if the Peace Agreement is implemented in good faith by all parties to the conflict.\nJustice is key to resolving the crisis in the Central African Republic and will be the decisive\nfactor in the success of the peace process.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.19-13726 (E)\n\n020919\n\n\n\n030919\n\n",

In resolution 39/2, the\nCouncil also decided that the Mechanism would, inter alia, report on its main activities on\nan annual basis to the Council as of the forty-second session. The present report is\nsubmitted to the Council pursuant to that request.\nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 73/264, welcomed the creation of the\nMechanism and called for its expeditious entry into operation and steps to secure its\neffective functioning as soon as possible.\nSince the Head of the Mechanism, Nicholas Koumjian, officially commenced his\nfunctions on 1 July 2019, he has focused on putting in place place a broad strategy and\nconcept of operations for the Mechanism with the assistance of the Secretariat, so that the\nMechanism will be operational and functional as soon as possible. In this regard, the\nMechanism has sought to learn from the experiences of international tribunals and other\ncomparable international accountability mechanisms to ensure effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe Mechanism has identified a number of initial priorities that will put in place the\ntechnical, logistical and administrative measures necessary for the effective functioning of\nthe Mechanism and the implementation of its mandate.\nThe Mechanism anticipates, however, that its substantive strategies will have to be\nflexible and in order to adjust in accordance with developments in its investigations and\nrealities on the ground.\nThe Mechanism is still at a very early stage of its operations and is fully cognizant\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.19-13466(E)\n\n\n\n",

The de facto authorities responded to the questions posed in writing\nand agreed to a visit of the Group of Experts to Sana’a, however the lack of cooperation by\nthe Government and coalition members prevented any access to Yemen. Despite access\nconstraints, the Group of Experts gathered a wide array of evidence related to allegations of\nviolations of international law in Yemen since September 2014.\nThe Group of Experts found reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the\nconflict in Yemen are responsible for an array of human rights violations and violations of\ninternational humanitarian law. Some of these violations are likely to amount to war\ncrimes. The summary of these findings is included in A/HRC/42/17.\nThis report presents the details of the findings by the Group of Experts with regard\nto the practical impact of these violations on the lives of ordinary Yemenis, which has been\nimmense and wide ranging.

The High Commissioner is concerned by\nvarious signs indicating a possible reversal of past commitments by the Government,\nwhich would set back the promotion of reconciliation, accountability and human rights,\nreduce civic space and erode important institutional safeguards. The overall goals of\nresolution 30/1 must be protected and built upon to provide justice and redress to\nvictims, guarantee the non-recurrence of past patterns of human rights violations and\npromote peaceful, inclusive and sustainable development.\nThe High Commissioner encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to fully\nimplement resolution 30/1 and continue to engage positively with OHCHR and the\nUnited Nations human rights mechanisms to promote reconciliation, accountability and\nhuman rights as critical elements for the implementation of the Sustainable Development\nGoals. She urges the Human Rights Council to maintain its close monitoring of and\nengagement on developments in Sri Lanka.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline so as to include the most recent information.\nGE.20-02964(E)\n\n\n\n",

The report contains Guidelines for the Implementation of the Right to Adequate\nHousing, focusing on the key requirements of effective rights-based responses to emerging\nchallenges.\nThe current global crisis in housing is unlike any previous crisis. It is linked to\ngrowing socioeconomic inequality, large-scale financialization of housing and land and\nunsustainable housing systems that treat housing as a commodity. In the Special\nRapporteur’s experience, States are not always aware of how human rights obligations\napply in the context of housing and, more importantly, of how those obligations can be\ntranslated into concrete actions to address the crisis.\nThe Guidelines provide States with a set of implementation measures in key areas of\nconcern, including homelessness and the unaffordability of housing, migration, evictions,\nclimate change, the upgrading of informal settlements, inequality and the regulation of\nbusinesses. All of the implementation measures are informed by the urgent need to reclaim\nhousing as a fundamental human right. Implementation of the Guidelines will substantially\nalter how States treat housing, creating a new landscape where housing can be secured as a\nhuman right for all.\n\nGE.19-22537(E)\n\n\n\n",

As a result,\ninformal settlements are growing, with inhabitants lacking the most basic services and\nfacing forced evictions. Meanwhile, luxury developments remain vacant. The Special\nRapporteur pays particular attention to the discrimination and criminalization of certain\ngroups, including women, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, persons with\ndisabilities and persons living with HIV/AIDS. The Special Rapporteur calls for the\ncessation of forced evictions, an ambitious tax reform that will increase public revenue and\ntackle inequality, and the creation of a rights-based housing strategy that focuses on the\nmost vulnerable groups of society.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

The majority of\nindividuals in France enjoy access to adequate housing. Furthermore, the country has a\nlarge social housing stock and has allocated substantial resources for housing benefits and\nemergency housing.\nDespite these efforts, housing affordability has become a significant problem. In\nmost metropolitan areas, there is an insufficient supply of social housing for those most in\nneed. While the right to housing can be claimed, applicants who do so are often allocated\nhousing only after several years. National law strictly prohibits discrimination in terms of\naccess to housing, but many persons perceived as coming from the Arab world or Africa\ndo experience such discrimination.\nInformal settlements inhabited by Roma, migrants and other groups in vulnerable\nsituations are often denied basic services and regularly subjected to forced evictions, in\nviolation of human rights standards. Homelessness is increasing at a significant pace and\nthere are too few emergency shelters and longer-term housing options for these groups.\nRefugees and migrants live in some of the most egregious conditions. There is a lack of\nunits for independent living for persons with disabilities. The Special Rapporteur\nconcludes her report with a call for immediate action and with several recommendations\nto ensure that the human right to adequate housing is fully enjoyed by all.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Over the past\nsix years, Hilal Elver has gained a unique insight into the global state of the right to food.\nSuch knowledge has led her to conclude that, despite the Sustainable Development Goal of\n“zero hunger” and malnutrition by 2030, the realization of the right to food remains a\ndistant, if not impossible, reality for far too many. In the present report, the Special\nRapporteur offers a critical perspective on the trends that have led to this reality and a\nreview of new developments that have the potential to change the status quo. She also looks\nto the future, highlighting the roles and responsibilities of key players in advancing the\nright to food. The recommendations set forth in the report are intended to facilitate the\nwork of subsequent Special Rapporteurs and contribute to the mandate’s institutional\nmemory.

The fragility of the\neconomy because of its heavy dependence on oil and gas production highlights a need for\ndiversification by increasing investments in the non-oil sector. The Government is\ntherefore focusing its efforts on developing the country’s agricultural potential and on\nincreasing productivity to guarantee economic stability. Azerbaijan has made impressive\nefforts to establish new institutions. The challenge now is to ensure that the right to food is\nprovided for all and the related goals are implemented through the allocation of adequate\nbudgets and securing growth that benefits all levels of society. That effort is still in its early\nstages and needs to incorporate a human rights-based approach to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment in the agricultural sector that is sensitive to the needs and traditions of the\ncountry’s regions and people of different ethnic backgrounds.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

There are two drivers of the\nrising private indebtedness: first, the flourishing supply side of finance, with deregulation\nand increasing financialization being its facilitating instruments; second, the reconfiguration\nof many human needs for social reproduction that become unmet financial needs paralleled\nby a colossal failure of the State to ensure economic, social and cultural rights for all. The\nIndependent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial\nobligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social\nand cultural rights, Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, studies the negative human rights implications\nof microcredit, health, education and housing-related debts, abusive collection practices,\nincluding the criminalization of debtors, consumers and migration-related debts, and debt\nbondage.

The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the social and\npolitical imperatives of addressing violent extremism but underscores that only rightsaffirming and rights-focused policies will have long-term success in preventing violence.\nShe underscores the lack of a robust scientific basis for the current policies and practices\naimed at preventing and countering violent extremism and the complete absence of human\nrights-based monitoring and evaluation, including by United Nations entities.\nThe Special Rapporteur cautions against the simplistic deployment of policy aimed at\npreventing and countering violent extremism in complex conflict and fragile settings,\nwhere a broader spectrum of interconnected interventions is necessary to stem violent\nextremism. She notes in particular the lack of precise legal definitions of extremism and\nviolent extremism and the widespread abuses of human rights that that produces.\nViolations of derogable and non-derogable rights are experienced particularly by religious\ngroups, minority groups and civil society. The Special Rapporteur notes the persistent lack\nof meaningful consultation with and participation of communities targeted by measures to\nprevent and counter violent extremism. She highlights the commodification of women and\ngirls to advance policy aimed at preventing and countering violent extremism, identifying\nmultiple ethical concerns. She reminds United Nations entities of their foundational due\ndiligence obligations when supporting technical assistance in and capacity-building on\npreventing and countering violent extremism.\n\n* The present report was submitted to the conference services after the deadline in order to reflect the\nmost recent developments.\n\nGE.20-02738(E)\n\n\n\n",

She affirms that, not only is this the\npositive implementation of its international obligations under Security Council resolution\n2178 (2014), it constitutes a welcome humanitarian response to the plight of those women,\nmen and children who are detained in overcrowded camps in the north-east of the Syrian\nArab Republic in inhuman conditions.\nThe Special Rapporteur identifies a number of significant human rights challenges\nresulting from the security, counter-terrorism and extremism frameworks that are\noperational in Kazakhstan. She finds that significant aspects of the criminal law concerning\nterrorism and extremism are broad and vaguely defined, impinging directly on fundamental\nhuman rights protected by international law, including but not limited to the rights to\nexpression, movement, family life, and freedom of religion and belief. She is seriously\nconcerned about the use of the term “extremism” in national law and practice.

In a\nnumber of States worldwide, religious precepts underlie laws and State-sanctioned\npractices that constitute violations of the right to non-discrimination of women, girls and\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) persons. In other States, claims of\nreligious freedom are being used to roll back and seek exemptions to laws that protect\nagainst gender-based violence and discrimination. The Special Rapporteur provides\nemblematic cases of both these phenomena and their impact on gender equality and\nfreedom of religion or belief worldwide. He explores freedom of religion or belief and\nnon-discrimination as two and mutually reinforcing rights and clarifies the existing\ninternational legal framework that governs their intersection. He concludes by\nemphasizing the responsibility of States to create enabling environments to advance the\nnon-discrimination and freedom of religion of belief rights of women, girls and LGBT+\npersons.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline so as to include the most recent information.\nGE.20-11079(E)\n\n\n\n",

The Special Rapporteur finds that the\nNetherlands possesses the requisite legal and policy framework for promoting and\nprotecting the enjoyment by all persons of the right to freedom of thought, conscience,\nand religion or belief. However, politically expedient responses to a diversifying society,\ntogether with the equation of secularism with neutrality, pose challenges to the\nsubstantial framework already in place to guarantee freedom of religion or belief to all,\nand highlight the concerns aired by religious communities, including Jewish and Muslim\ncommunities, about growing intolerance towards them. In his report, the Special\nRapporteur notes that the Government appears to be quite cognizant and reflective about\nmany of the concerns outlined in his report. The Government’s investments in\nprogrammes for monitoring, reporting and responding to developments that undermine\nthe equal enjoyment of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief\nhave been extensive and laudable. Initiatives aimed at addressing these concerns have\nnot yet generated the desired comprehensive, systematic change within society, but\nefforts to strengthen the capacity of frontline actors, including the police, social workers,\nhuman rights defenders, lawyers, doctors and teachers, to foster environments where\nhuman rights principles can be promoted and respected, should continue to be supported.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Despite progress\nin this area, there is still a high level of impunity.

The main objective of the visit was to\nassess the situation of human rights defenders in the context of the State’s obligations and\ncommitments under international human rights law, including the Declaration on the Right\nand Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect\nUniversally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\nIn the report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the legal and institutional framework\nfor the protection of human rights defenders and the environment in which they operate. He\nfinds that a significant number of laws generally guarantees the rights and freedoms of\nhuman rights defenders in the country, but he is concerned with the State’s failure to\neffectively implement these laws in practice. He appreciates that Mongolia is, in general, a\nrelatively safe country for human rights defenders, but he believes this relatively safe\nenvironment does not translate into a situation where human rights defenders are\nencouraged, enabled and empowered in their activities. Obstacles such as stigmatization,\npressure, criminalization, hate speech on social media, and recent political discourse and\nlegislative amendments hinder the work of human rights defenders. He concludes that a\nrobust law to protect human rights defenders, which the Government began working on\nprior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur, would prove to be a powerful step forward for\nthe recognition and protection of human rights defenders in the country.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Political\nelites remained oblivious to the intense suffering of millions of civilians for whom they were\nostensibly fighting. As facilitators and guarantors of the Agreement, neither the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development nor the African Union have been able to exert\ndecisive influence on the parties. Even though regional efforts yielded an extension of the\npre-transitional period, States often pursued divergent goals in relation to South Sudan.\nHaving missed two deadlines in May and November 2019, and with a third now looming,\nunresolved issues remain: the training and deployment of the Necessary Unified Forces,\nestablishing the number of states and boundaries, the restructuring of the Council of States\nand the enactment of the Constitutional Amendment Bill.\nGovernment forces moreover continued to forcibly recruit men and boys into their\nranks through extensive campaigns in Warrap, Western Bahr el-Ghazal and Unity States,\nwhile opposition forces forcibly recruited men and boys in Unity and Central Equatoria\nStates. Hostilities involving the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces, local militias and the\nNational Salvation Front– a non-signatory to the Revitalized Agreement– also continued in\nflashpoint areas, including Yei and Lobonok (Central Equatoria) and Maiwut (Upper Nile).\nIncidents of armed conflict confirmed an ongoing threat to peace and security, and the urgent\nneed to address comprehensively issues relating to accountability, entrenched impunity and\nthe arming of local militias and holdout groups.\nBeyond the fragile peace at the national level, localized and often ethnically-based\ntensions intensified, leading to an increase of nearly 200 per cent in the number of civilian\ncasualties over 2018. Between late February and May 2019, the United Nations Mission in\nSouth Sudan recorded some 531 deaths and 317 injuries in 152 incidents of localized\nviolence.

Multiple, rapidly shifting alliances\namong these parties continue to create volatility and power vacuums that facilitate\nviolations of international law. The absence of an effective peace process, coupled with\nthe failure of conflicting parties to provide unfettered access to humanitarian actors and\nindependent monitors, renders distant the prospect of improving the immediate protection\nenvironment for civilians.\nThe operations by Turkish forces and the Syrian National Army, under the moniker\nOperation Peace Spring, followed the sudden withdrawal of troops of the United States of\nAmerica in early October. The resulting rapid waves of civilians fleeing from the area\nbetween Ayn Isa and Tall Tamr contributed to an already dire displacement situation for\nmany, including children, in areas under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces.\nAs battles waged over strategic areas in southern Idlib, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham\nterrorists attempted to tighten their grip over the population. Activists, journalists and\ncivilians continue to be unlawfully detained for criticizing the group’s mounting\ninterference. Pro-government forces also carried out aerial and ground attacks in southern\nIdlib against terrorist organizations, striking civilian infrastructure, including protected\nobjects such as medical facilities. Access to medical care for the wounded was thus\nundermined, while attacks on women’s and children’s hospitals prevented pregnant\nwomen and new mothers from receiving medical care. Between May 2019 and early\nJanuary 2020, these attacks caused the displacement of 700,000 civilians.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\n** The annexes to the present report are circulated as received, in the language of submission only.\nGE.20-01305(E)\n\n\n\n",

Since the start of hostilities, children in the country have been victimized in\nnumerous ways, and left to endure multiple violations of their rights by all parties of the\nconflict.\nRobbed of their childhood and forced to participate in a brutal war, children have been\nkilled and maimed in vast numbers. In addition to regularly targeting children using sniper\nfire, pro-Government forces have also deployed cluster munitions, thermobaric bombs and\nchemical weapons, often against civilian objects such as schools and hospitals. Government\nforces have also detained boys as young as 12, subjecting them to severe beatings and torture,\nand denying them access to food, water, sanitation and medical care. In detention centres,\nbut also much more broadly, rape and sexual violence have been used against men, women,\nboys and girls as a tool to punish, humiliate and instil fear among affected communities. Such\nacts resulted in movement restrictions on girls, with many being removed from school, and\ncompelled families to relocate.\nArmed groups targeted schools and carried out attacks on areas under the control of\nthe Government, causing scores of child casualties. Children were also detained and used to\nextract ransom, or as bargaining chips to initiate prisoner swaps with Government forces and\naffiliated militias.\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist group subjected girls as young\nas nine to sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence and systematically recruited and\nused children for direct participation in hostilities. The group also launched indiscriminate\nattacks on towns and villages that killed and injured scores of children. Most emblematically,\nchildren were both victims of public executions and forced into the role of executor by the\ngroup. In areas under the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) terrorists, boys were also recruited\nfor combat roles and large numbers of girls were prevented from attending school.\n\n* Reproduced as received, in the language of submission only.\nGE.20-00227(E)\n\n\n\n",

The Government of Eritrea remains opposed to engaging in\ncooperation under the mandate. The Special Rapporteur has continued to monitor the\nhuman rights situation in the country by conducting field missions to third countries and by\nengaging with a broad range of stakeholders.\nDuring the period under review, the Special Rapporteur has found no evidence of a\nsubstantial improvement in the situation of human rights in the country. While Eritrea has\nincreased its engagement with regional and international actors throughout the reporting\nperiod, this engagement has not yet translated into tangible reforms in human rights. A\ntelling sign is that Eritreans continue to flee the country in large numbers.

In the present report, the Special\nRapporteur analyses the issues she considers to be the most pressing from a human rights\nperspective. Acting within a human rights framework is indeed crucial to ensuring that\nmeasures adopted in response to the pandemic do not jeopardize the right to education and\ndo not increase the suffering of the most marginalized.\nThe Special Rapporteur stresses that while numerous innovative measures have been\nadopted in all corners of the globe by many governmental and non-governmental\nstakeholders to ensure some continuity of education, they could never have been expected\nto compensate for the patent global lack of preparedness for a crisis of this magnitude. Past\nfailures to build strong and resilient education systems and to fight entrenched inequalities\nhave had a dramatic impact on the most vulnerable and marginalized, a situation to which\nno temporary measure adopted in haste could have fully responded.\nThe Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations. In particular, she\nrecommends that a thorough assessment be conducted to unpack, in each local context, the\ndynamics at play that have led to increased discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to\neducation during the crisis. Such an assessment should include an analysis of rising\ninequalities due to the measures adopted to face the pandemic; an investigation into the\n* The present report was submitted late to the conference services without the explanation required\nunder paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 53/208 B.\n.\n\nGE.20-08533(E)\n\n\n\n",

The aim of the visit was to gather first-hand\ninformation on the effectiveness of the right to free, quality and inclusive education for all,\nand to engage in a dialogue with and offer recommendations to the Government and other\nstakeholders in that regard.\nThe Special Rapporteur congratulates Qatar for the priority granted to establishing\nquality education for all, and for the many measures and programmes adopted in this\nregard. She is particularly impressed by the will demonstrated by many stakeholders “to\nbuild a modern world-class educational system that provides students with a first-rate\neducation, comparable to that offered anywhere in the world”, as part of the National\nVision 2030. She also welcomes the strong involvement of Qatar in regional and\ninternational cooperation to promote the right to education for all. The crucial work of the\nEducation Above All foundation and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and\nCommunity Development is making a real difference for many people within and outside\nQatar.\nNevertheless, the Special Rapporteur identified a number of challenges that should\nbe addressed, bearing in mind the State’s recent accession to the two International\nCovenants on Human Rights. In particular, while Qatar should be congratulated for\nmaintaining and valuing its public schools, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about\nwhat appears to be an increasing over-reliance on the role of the private sector, especially\nwhen it comes to educating children of migrant workers. Furthermore, education is not free\nof charge for a very high proportion of children residing in Qatar, particularly non-Qatari\nchildren, in contravention of provisions of international human rights law.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

The world is at an existential crossroads\ninvolving a pandemic, a deep economic recession, devastating climate change, extreme\ninequality, and an uprising against racist policies. Running through all of these challenges is\nthe longstanding neglect of extreme poverty by many governments, economists, and human\nrights advocates.\nBy single-mindedly focusing on the World Bank’s flawed international poverty line, the\ninternational community mistakenly gauges progress in eliminating poverty by reference to\na standard of miserable subsistence rather than an even minimally adequate standard of\nliving. This in turn facilitates greatly exaggerated claims about the impending eradication of\nextreme poverty and downplays the parlous state of impoverishment in which billions of\npeople still subsist.\nWhile the Sustainable Development Goals have achieved a great deal, they are failing in\nrelation to key goals such as poverty eradication, economic equality, gender equality, and\nclimate change. They need to be recalibrated in response to COVID-19, the ensuing\nrecession, and accelerating global warming.\nPoverty is a political choice and its elimination requires: (i) reconceiving the relationship\nbetween growth and poverty elimination; (ii) tackling inequality and embracing\nredistribution; (iii) promoting tax justice; (iv) implementing universal social protection; (v)\ncentering the role of government; (vi) embracing participatory governance; and (vii) adapting\ninternational poverty measurement.\n\n* The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent developments.\n\n",

Rigorous independent analyses show that the claim to have all but eliminated poverty\nis just not true. While Malaysia has done an impressive job of reducing poverty in recent\ndecades, millions of people still scrape by on very low incomes with tenuous access to\nfood, shelter, education and health care, and limited ability to exercise civil and political\nrights. Denying the existence of poverty has stymied progress, encouraged significant\nunderinvestment in poverty reduction, caused widespread misunderstanding of who is poor\nand led to bad policymaking.\nFollowing the Special Rapporteur’s visit, the then Prime Minister and other officials\nindicated that the Government was ready to review the poverty line to provide a more\naccurate picture of poverty. Sadly, recent developments under the new Government raise\nserious concerns that this initiative is now off track.\nCorrecting the poverty line must be seen as an urgent priority. It must also be just\nthe first step on a path that includes rewriting the policy narrative on poverty, recognizing\nthat it is not just an isolated problem for indigenous peoples or those in rural areas but a\nmuch more prevalent and frequently urban phenomenon. The Government should institute\nfar-reaching reforms of the fragmented and inadequately funded social protection system,\nfollow through on promises made to indigenous peoples and address the plight of millions\nof non-citizens, including migrants, refugees, stateless people and unregistered Malaysians,\nwho are systematically excluded from official poverty figures and neglected by\npolicymakers.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

However, the benefits of the recovery have primarily flowed to the better-off,\nwhile people in poverty have been largely failed by policymakers.\nThe result is a persistence of deep widespread poverty, high unemployment, chronic\nyouth unemployment, a housing crisis of stunning proportions, largely inadequate social\nprotection arrangements, a segregated and increasingly anachronistic education system, tax\nand expenditure policies that provide far more benefits to the wealthy than the poor and a\nbureaucratic mentality that allows the authorities to shirk responsibility and values\nformalistic procedures over the well-being of people. It is abundantly clear that the system\nfor providing social assistance is broken, underfunded, impossible to navigate and not\nreaching the people who need it most.\nThe formation of a new Government presents an opportunity for change. With its\nembrace of social rights and fiscal justice, and prioritization of the living conditions of the\nmost vulnerable, its message is a welcome one. But actions must live up to the rhetoric.\nSpain needs innovative leadership at the national level, backed by resources to encourage\nautonomous communities to support far-reaching structural reforms.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Assistance and support from civil society organizations is crucial for\nmigrants, particularly for those in an irregular situation or with vulnerabilities. Given the\ninterconnected nature of human rights, restrictions on migrants’ and their defenders’\nfreedom of association further hinder migrants’ enjoyment of other rights. Encouraging\nmigrants to organize empowers them to engage with the host communities directly and\nenables them to have a positive impact in the communities and countries in which they\nreside.\n\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.20-06662(E)\n\n\n\n",

This included, in 2006, a dramatic reduction of worker protections in the Labour\nCode and the abolishment of the Labour Inspectorate, leaving workers, especially those\nperforming hazardous work, without adequate protection for almost a decade.\nThe Working Group was encouraged by the ongoing efforts to address remaining\ngaps in the labour rights and occupational health and safety regimes, including\nstrengthening the Labour Inspectorate mandate. However, numerous challenges remain in\naddressing the systematic human rights abuses against workers, particularly in the mining\nand infrastructure sectors.\nThe Working Group welcomed the adoption of a business and human rights chapter\nin the 2018–2020 National Action Plan on Human Rights. However, it expressed concern\nat the level of implementation of the chapter and suggested that measures be taken to\nstrengthen its content and institutional framework for implementation.\nThe Working Group notes the efforts of the Government to find a balanced\napproach towards attracting foreign investments, gaining energy independence, and\ndischarging State duties to protect against business-related human rights abuses.

It expressed its concern, however, at the degree of\nimplementation and the effectiveness of measures taken to address the root causes of social\nconflicts. It urged the Government to take urgent steps and to enact legislative and\ninstitutional reforms that would help to create an enabling environment for responsible\nbusiness conduct.\nThe Working Group observed the absence of a robust regulatory and institutional\nframework to protect against business-related human rights abuses and to provide access to\neffective remedy, in a context in which development projects and investments appear to have\noutpaced the protection of people and the environment. It observed that the lack of\naccountability for harm caused by businesses is often compounded by attacks, harassment\nand intimidation against those who speak out against abuses and demand accountability for\nvictims, which in turn have fuelled social conflicts and lack of trust in State institutions, with\nlong-lasting negative repercussions on local communities, businesses and investors.\nA root cause of most social conflicts is the systematic lack of transparency and\nmeaningful participation of affected communities in decisions regarding development\nprojects and the exploitation of natural resources, and in the energy and agribusiness sectors.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Prosecutors, as guarantors of the justice system, have\na responsibility to ensure respect for the rule of law based on the obligation to respect,\nprotect and uphold established human rights.\nTherefore, irrespective of the organizational model adopted by prosecution services,\ncombating corruption must be among the top priorities of every such service in the world.\nIn this regard, the United Nations Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors and the United\nNations Convention against Corruption serve as the fundamental reference frameworks on\nwhich prosecution services should base their efforts to combat corruption and address its\nimpact on human rights.\nIn the report, the Special Rapporteur presents the current state of affairs and\ndescribes the role of public prosecution services in the fight against corruption. He goes on\nto emphasize the importance of effective international cooperation in achieving the set\nobjectives. The report also highlights a number of good practices and ongoing challenges\nfor prosecution services in respect of cooperation and the fight against corruption.\nLastly, in the light of relevant international standards and the contributions of States\nand professional and civil society organizations, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of\nnormative, institutional and operational recommendations that will provide the necessary\ntools to tackle the issue of corruption.\n\nGE.20-04343 (E) 300420 300420\n\n\n\n",

The establishment of the Supreme Judicial Council, the reorganization of the\ncourt system, the new procedures for the selection and appointment of candidates to\njudicial offices, and the enactment of various measures to improve judicial training and\nsecurity of tenure could be regarded as positive steps towards the establishment of a truly\nindependent and impartial justice system. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done to\nensure that the judiciary is truly independent from other branches of the State, and that\njudges, prosecutors and lawyers are free to carry out their professional activities without\nany undue interference or pressure.\nA number of interferences continue to undermine both the independence of the\njudiciary from other branches of Government (institutional independence) and the\nindependence of individual judges to adjudicate the cases before them impartially and\nautonomously (personal independence). Prosecutors retain a prominent role in criminal\nproceedings, and the procedures for the appointment and dismissal of the ProsecutorGeneral do not provide sufficient guarantees to prevent undue political influence from the\nlegislative and executive branches of power, raising considerable concerns as to the\ninstitutional independence of the whole prosecution service.

The aim of the mission was to\nexamine the progress made by the country in implementing its obligations under human\nrights law to ensure the independence and impartiality of judges and prosecutors and the\nfree exercise of the legal profession by lawyers.\nThe Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by Honduras in recent years to\naddress the structural problems that continue to affect the country. Extreme poverty,\ndiscrimination and inequality, violence and insecurity, widespread corruption and a high\nlevel of impunity remain major challenges for Honduras, but some progress has been made,\nin particular with regard to the reduction in the homicide rate. In general terms, however,\nthe inability of State authorities to adequately address those challenges has generated a\ndeep discontent and lack of trust in the political class and State institutions, which also\naffects the judiciary and, to a lesser extent, the public prosecution service.\nThe efforts made to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the justice\nsystem have not yet had a significant result in strengthening access to justice and fighting\nimpunity. Underfunding, poorly trained staff and ineffectiveness result in lengthy judicial\nproceedings and a backlog of cases. Political and other forms of interference and pressure\nfrom non-State actors, along with low salaries, are at the root of the high level of judicial\ncorruption, with bribes and irregular payments often being exchanged for favourable court\ndecisions. Violence and impunity continues to be widespread, with more than 90 per cent\nof crimes remaining unpunished, despite the measures adopted to increase the human,\nfinancial and technical resources of the public prosecution service.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes the report by offering a number of\nrecommendations aimed at further strengthening the independence of judges and\nprosecutors and the free exercise of the legal profession.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

However, he also emphasizes that despite promising trends, there remains a\nglobal failure of the status quo to address human rights violations in mental health-care\nsystems. This frozen status quo reinforces a vicious cycle of discrimination,\ndisempowerment, coercion, social exclusion and injustice. To end the cycle, distress,\ntreatment and support must be seen more broadly and move far beyond a biomedical\nunderstanding of mental health. Global, regional and national conversations are needed to\ndiscuss how to understand and respond to mental health conditions. Those discussions and\nactions must be rights-based, holistic and rooted in the lived experience of those left\nfurthest behind by harmful sociopolitical systems, institutions and practices.\nThe Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations for States, for\norganizations representing the psychiatric profession and for the World Health\nOrganization.\n\nGE.20-05623(E)\n\n\n\n",

She notes, however, that Qatar needs to do more in the light of the\npersistent complex challenges that undermine its compliance with its international\nobligations and threaten the achievement of genuine equality and non-discrimination,\nincluding the overwhelming role that national origin and nationality currently play in\ndetermining access to human rights. She raises concerns regarding a de facto caste system\nbased on national origin, which results in structural discrimination against non-citizens,\nincluding as the result of immense power imbalances between employers and migrant\nworkers rooted in the kafala (sponsorship) system that historically structured labour\nrelations in Qatar. She commends the significant labour and immigration reforms\nimplemented by Qatar to improve conditions for low-income migrant workers, including\ndomestic workers, but urges further action in this regard.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

It\nalso highlights the impact on the protection of the human rights of all migrants of the\nincreased use of private military and security services in immigration and border\nmanagement.\nIn the report, the Working Group outlines the overall context in which these services\nare provided and the relevant normative framework. It examines four main categories of\nservices: provision of research and technical expertise; border security technologies and\nmonitoring services; immigration detention, returns and removals; and the implementation\nof “externalization” policies. It shines a light on the impact of these services on the human\nrights of all migrants. It then looks at the lack of transparency, oversight and accountability\nof companies operating in this sector, and the impact on effective remedies for victims of\nviolations and abuses by these companies.\nIt concludes that, at times, companies are directly responsible for human rights\nabuses of migrants, notably in situations of deprivation of liberty; while in other instances,\nthey are complicit in widespread human rights violations and abuse caused by other actors,\nsuch as immigration and border authorities.\nThe Working Group ends its report with recommendations addressed primarily to\nStates and private military and security companies, aimed at triggering a fundamental\nevaluation of the role that companies play in reinforcing security over humanitarian\napproaches to immigration and border management, as well as the specific security services\nthey provide in this sector.\n\nGE.20-09154(E)\n\n\n\n",

Pursuant to its\nmandate, the Working Group’s visit focused on private military and security companies on\nthe one hand and mercenary and mercenary-related activities on the other hand. With\nrespect to regulating private military and security services, Switzerland has been at the\nforefront of several international initiatives and has also taken concrete action to prevent\nthe risks that are associated with exporting such services abroad by putting in place relevant\nfederal legislation. This commitment is commendable, and brings expectations for\ncontinued Swiss strategic leadership and support in this area. The Working Group notes the\nimportance of continuing to raising awareness about, and implementing, the federal\nlegislation in its current broad scope, and of the need to move the relevant international\ninitiatives towards more practical impact on the ground.\nThe present report addresses domestic regulation of private security providers where\ndiverse practices exist at the cantonal level demonstrating the need for a nationwide\nframework. The lack of uniform standards within the industry represents a particular\nconcern as the number of private security personnel outnumbers police officers and there is\na growing market for private security services, including through contracts with public\nauthorities in sensitive areas, such as asylum centres. The Working Group also considered\nlegislation covering mercenaries and related actors.\nAfter outlining its findings, the Working Group makes recommendations concerning\nprivate military and security services provided abroad and domestically, and mercenary and\nmercenary-related activities.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

More than 20 years after the civil war ended, the wounds remain\ndeep, but go intentionally ignored. However, it is not too late for healing and\nreconciliation. It is most important that State authorities, in consultation with relevant\nstakeholders, develop and implement a comprehensive policy to address past abuses on\nall sides, including enforced disappearances. There is also an urgent need to engage in a\nprocess of investigation, exhumation and identification of the remains of disappeared\nand missing persons so that they can be handed over to those persons’ families.\nThe Working Group stresses that enforced disappearances cannot be considered\nan issue of the past. Enforced disappearance is a continuous crime that persists until the\nfate and whereabouts of a forcibly disappeared person are clarified. The lack of judicial\nenquiries and the continuing impunity for cases of enforced disappearance are not only\nviolations of the victims’ rights to truth and justice, but may also be a source of future\nviolations.\nThe classification of some opposition parties as “extremist” or “terrorist”\norganizations, and the escalation of harassment and imprisonment of their members have\nled to alleged extraterritorial abductions and enforced disappearances in recent years.\nVictims of violations, their family members and human rights defenders,\nincluding lawyers, continue to face reprisals from State authorities for speaking out.\nReportedly, there is a climate of self-censorship and fear among such groups.

The\nGovernment of Kyrgyzstan has made significant legislative improvements in the protection\nagainst enforced disappearance in recent years. In particular, the introduction of the new\ncrime of enforced disappearance and legislative changes improving the notification and\nregistration requirements during initial apprehension and detention are positive\ndevelopments.\nHowever, despite these measures and the statements made by the country’s\nleadership about there being strong political will and about robust action being taken to\ncounter enforced disappearance and torture, substantive changes in practice are still\nlacking. A concerted effort is needed, in particular, to eradicate the widespread problem\nof enforced disappearance of short duration following the initial apprehension of\nsuspects, as now defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nAdherence to the principle of non-refoulement is important for strengthening\nprotection against enforced disappearance. The Working Group on Enforced or\nInvoluntary Disappearances reiterates the need to ensure that the principle is enshrined in\nKyrgyz legislation and implemented in practice and that no individual is expelled,\nreturned or extradited to a State where there are substantial grounds to believe that he or\nshe may be at risk of enforced disappearance.\nMoreover, there continues to be a small number of individuals missing and of\nbodies pending identification in relation to the inter-ethnic violence that broke out in the\nsouthern provinces in 2010. The Working Group encourages the Government to\nundertake further efforts to resolve these cases and to fully address the consequences of\nthe events.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

It continues to\nobserve alarming patterns of impunity, both in relation to past acts of enforced\ndisappearance and to new disappearances occurring in different parts of the world.\nImpunity can have a multiplying effect, which causes additional suffering and\nanguish to the victims and their families. The Working Group believes that the\ninternational community should not stand neutral in the face of such suffering. Instead, it\nmust strengthen cooperation efforts, increase the assistance available to victims and\npursue judicial investigations and prosecutions both at the local and international levels.\nThe distinctive components of an enforced disappearance – in particular, the\nparticipation of State agents and the attempts to conceal information and cover up the\ncrime – necessitate that investigations be carried out with the requisite independence and\nautonomy.\nDelays in investigations are usually the result of multiple obstacles faced during\njudicial proceedings, including the destruction or loss of evidence and the passing of the\nperpetrators, victims and witnesses. Such obstacles may lead to de facto impunity.\nThe Working Group concludes that an effective investigation of enforced\ndisappearances must include information about the whereabouts and the fates of the\ndisappeared persons, the circumstances of their disappearance and the identity of the\nperpetrators. Such an investigation is not only required by the State’s international\nobligations, but it is also the best way to effectively combat impunity and to realize the\n* Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitters’ control.\n\n** The annex to the present document is being circulated as received, in the language of submission only.\nGE.20-10542(E)\n\n*2010542*\n\n",

It also\ntransmitted 61 urgent appeals to 31 Governments and, in one case, to other actors, as well as\n80 letters of allegations and other letters to 43 Governments and, in one case, other actors,\nconcerning at least 377 identified individuals. Some States informed the Working Group that\nthey had taken measures to remedy the situations of detainees and, in multiple cases, the\ndetainees were released. The Working Group is grateful to those Governments that\nresponded to its appeals and took steps to provide it with the information requested on the\nsituation of detainees.\nAs part of its continuous dialogue with States, the Working Group conducted country\nvisits to Qatar, from 3 to 14 November 2019, and to Greece, from 2 to 13 December 2019.\nThe Working Group continued to formulate deliberations on matters of a general\nnature to assist States and stakeholders in preventing and addressing cases of arbitrary\ndeprivation of liberty. This included development of deliberation No. 10 on reparations for\narbitrary deprivation of liberty and deliberation No. 11 on prevention of arbitrary deprivation\nof liberty in the context of public health emergencies.\nFurthermore, in cooperation with the Working Group on discrimination against\nwomen and girls, the Working Group developed a joint amicus curiae brief addressing the\narrest and detention of applicants who were among 71 women suspected of being sex workers\nand allegedly physically and sexually assaulted while in custody.\nIn the report, the Working Group also examines the following thematic issues: (a)\nwomen deprived of liberty; (b) the right to legal assistance in preventing arbitrary deprivation\nof liberty; (c) modern technologies and alternatives to detention.\nIn its recommendations, the Working Group calls for States to increase their\ncooperation with regard to their responses to regular communications, by reporting through\n The annexes are being circulated without formal editing, in the language of submission only.\nGE.20-09970(E)\n\n\n\n",

The Working Group identified positive\ndevelopments, including the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the\ndesignation of the Greek Ombudsman as the national preventive mechanism, and the use of\nalternatives to detention and provisions for early release. At the same time, there were\nchallenges in the criminal justice system, such as widespread pretrial detention, insufficient\nawareness of the right to legal assistance and instances of short trials. In the context of\nmigration, the Working Group observed, among other issues, a lack of awareness among\ndetainees of their right to apply for international protection and of the procedural\nrequirements, a substantial burden on shelters for unaccompanied children, instances of\ninaccurate application of procedures for the assessment of age and vulnerability, and\ninsufficient legal aid to challenge detention and removal decisions. Lastly, the Working\nGroup found that the procedure for involuntary admission of persons with psychosocial\ndisabilities remained problematic, and identified delays in consideration of involuntary\nadmissions by the courts and lack of access to a lawyer to challenge mental health\nassessments. Among its recommendations, the Working Group encourages Greece to\nbecome a party to several human rights instruments and to adopt specific practices that\noffer greater protection against arbitrary detention.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

The Working Group commends progress made in\nQatar and identifies a number of positive developments, including in relation to the accession\nby Qatar to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2018, the work of the\nNational Human Rights Committee and the existence of oversight mechanisms monitoring\nplaces of deprivation of liberty, as well as the community-based approach taken to\npsychosocial care. At the same time, the Working Group identifies significant challenges in\nthe criminal justice system with regard to preventing arbitrary detention, such as ensuring\nprompt presentation of detainees before a judicial authority, guaranteeing detainees access\nto legal assistance and interpretation during trial proceedings, and excessive reliance on\ndetention before trial. Detention registers in police stations do not contain proper safeguards\nagainst the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. A large number of individuals are detained due\nto inability to repay a debt. State security and counter-terrorism legislation, as well as laws\nfor the protection of the community, allow for unsupervised administrative detention, placing\nthe individual away from judicial protection for prolonged periods. The existing legal\nframework and practices permit de facto deprivation of liberty by private actors. There is\nalso an urgent need for a significant strengthening of the independence of civil society and\nthe legal profession. Among its recommendations to address issues identified during the visit,\nthe Working Group encourages Qatar to become a party to all the major human rights treaties,\nand to adopt legislative amendments and specific practices that offer greater protection\nagainst arbitrary detention.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

The perpetrators were seeking to deprive the main\nopposition party of any chance of winning the election. These violations were mainly\ncommitted by members of the Imbonerakure youth league of the ruling party and by local\nofficials who continue to enjoy nearly total impunity. Officers of the National Intelligence\nService and the police often participated in or supported such violations or, in the case of the\npolice, sometimes stood by and allowed the perpetrators to act. The judiciary has also taken\npart in this repression.\nThe survey on the economic underpinnings of the State has shown that corruption and illicit\nfinancial flows have a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights in Burundi. Aside\nfrom the political transition currently under way, most risk factors still remain, and farreaching reforms are required to improve the situation in the medium and long term.\n\n* The annexes to the present document are reproduced as received, in the language of submission only.\n** Agreement was reached to publish the present report after the standard publication date owing to\ncircumstances beyond the submitter’s control.\n\nGE.20-10689 (E)\n\n310820\n\n\n\n020920\n\n",

Indigenous peoples in\nthe Congo are slowly gaining recognition in society, with direct discrimination in some\ninstances receding, but continue to suffer from severe indirect and systemic discrimination.\nIndigenous peoples live in a markedly worse state of poverty and disempowerment than the\nBantu population. Access to health care, education and employment were the major\nconcerns raised by indigenous peoples during the visit, as well as lack of security of tenure\nand restrictions on their way of life due to encroachment on their traditional lands by\nprivate actors, including without their informed consent. The Special Rapporteur did not\nobserve any significant improvement in indigenous peoples’ right to participate in public\nlife. Climate change, in spite of the Congo basin being considered one of the richest areas\nin terms of biodiversity, has an impact on the way of life of those still dependent on the\nforest for survival.\nIn the present report, the Special Rapporteur assesses the progress that has been\nachieved towards implementing the recommendations made following the 2010 visit and\nidentifies additional challenges affecting indigenous peoples, in particular regarding\nconservation and climate change.\n\n* The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Progress has been hindered by a lack of commitment on the part of the\nGovernment. As a result, Sri Lanka appears to have missed an historic opportunity to\nprovide lessons to the world about how sustainable peace ought to be achieved.\nThe Special Rapporteur concludes with recommendations addressed to the\nGovernment concerning confidence-building measures, truth-seeking mechanisms,\naccountability, reparation programmes and guarantees of non-recurrence.\n\n* Reissued for technical reasons on 14 August 2020.\n** The summary of the report is being circulated in all official languages.

Its submission takes\nplace in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which has had a negative\nimpact on the implementation of the mandate of the team of international experts. The\nperiod in question was marked by a relative lull in the violence in the Kasai region, despite\ndaily human rights violations, continuing crime and a worsened humanitarian situation.\nThere is a serious humanitarian crisis there due to the massive return of several hundred\nthousand Congolese nationals, most of whom were expelled by the Angolan authorities,\nsupposedly to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by relieving crowding at prisons and\nexpelling undocumented foreigners. The problem is compounded by a difficult political\ncontext, with several provincial assemblies and governments in crisis.\nDespite this difficult context, the team of international experts has noted definite\nprogress in the judicial processing of cases opened in the context of the crisis affecting\nKasai between 2016 and 2018. Such progress, however, falls short, as the fight against\nimpunity is still a challenge that is far from being met by the Congolese justice system.\nSeveral recommendations made in previous reports have not yet been implemented\nby the State; such is the case for the disarmament of all militia members, followed by their\nsocial and economic reintegration; the freeing of the women taken hostage by the Bana\nMura militia; and the provision of sufficient human and material resources to the judiciary\nto enable it to carry out its work in a timely manner and in acceptable conditions.\nWith regard to strategies for reconciliation, transitional justice, victim assistance\nand reparations, the team of international experts notes that there has been progress in\nthe implementation of the project entitled Peace, Justice, Reconciliation and\nReconstruction in Kasai Central, with community consultations and the establishment of\na drafting committee tasked with drawing up a decree for the implementation of the\nrecommendations.

It\nhas also created some uncertainty regarding its operations for the remainder of 2020 and\n2021, particularly with respect to its ability to conduct missions for engagement and\nevidence-collection purposes. Nonetheless, since the onset of the pandemic, the Mechanism\nhas largely been able to continue its work by adjusting and adapting its operations and\nprocesses in accordance with the changes in circumstances. The Mechanism will continue\nto do so and will implement its mandate to the best of its ability despite ongoing restrictions\nand limitations.\nMoving forward, the Mechanism will seek to further expand its collection,\npreservation and analysis activities, which will be supported by missions if circumstances\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic allow. It will also seek to expand the procurement of\nthe necessary technical equipment, software and specialized capabilities. In addition, the\nMechanism will remain proactive in sharing evidentiary materials with courts and tribunals\nwhen all appropriate conditions, including the safety, security and privacy of information\nproviders, are satisfied. Finally, the Mechanism will continue to implement its engagement\nand public outreach strategy in order to provide up-to-date and accurate information\nregarding the Mechanism to its various stakeholders.\nIn order to deliver on its mandate, the Mechanism will continue to assess the\nrelevant circumstances, including with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic; review its\nmethodology and practices; and strengthen its operations through creative and flexible\nsolutions. Ultimately, the Mechanism aims to resolve the various challenges that are likely\nto arise and collect all relevant evidence in an efficient and effective manner, in order to\nenable perpetrators of serious international crimes in Myanmar to be brought to justice.\n\nGE.20-09060(E)\n\n\n\n",

Around 1.67 million people are currently displaced internally, languishing\nin camps that barely meet their basic needs and subsisting on rapidly diminishing\nhumanitarian aid. South Sudan enjoys the unenviable status of representing the third\nlargest refugee crisis in the world, with over 2.2 million people having fled abroad as\nrefugees and asylum seekers. At present, 7.5 million residents now require humanitarian\nassistance, and 1.3 million children under the age of five years are predicted to suffer\nfrom malnutrition, which is the highest rate of child malnutrition in the past four years.\nOn-going armed conflict in Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Lakes, Unity, Western Bahr el\nGhazal, and Warrap States, as well as in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area, continues\nto obstruct the work of humanitarian actors struggling to ameliorate the crisis. Coinciding\nwith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sudan on 5 April 2020, prices for\nstaple foods and basic commodities have also escalated drastically, further rendering\nvulnerable civilians food insecure.\nOver the past seven years, the brutal armed conflict has impacted mainly on the\ncivilian population, resulting in acute food insecurity and malnutrition across South\nSudan which is manifested by several causes, including both intentional and indirect\nfactors. There has been a spike in food insecurity in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Jonglei\nStates which is linked directly to the conflict and therefore almost entirely humaninduced. Pervasive human rights violations, as well as deliberate strategies on the part of\nboth Government and opposition forces to use starvation of civilians as a method of\n\n*\n\nThe information contained in the present document should be read in conjunction with the report of the\nCommission on Human Rights in South Sudan (A/HRC/43/56).\n\n",

Chapter V envisages a holistic set of\ncomplementary mechanisms for this purpose, namely, the Hybrid Court for South Sudan,\nthe Commission on Truth, Reconciliation, and Healing, and the Compensation and\nReparation Authority. These measures were designed by the African Union as appropriate\nto an African and South Sudanese context.\nYet, more than two years since the signing of the Revitalised Agreement on\nResolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, there has been no concrete progress in realising\nany accountability, national healing, or reconciliation in South Sudan. Persistent political\ncontestation between parties to the peace agreement has resulted in significant delays in\nimplementation of key measures.\nInstead, the failure to address underlying causes of the 2013 conflict has fuelled the\npolitical competition for South Sudan’s resources and corruption between political elites\ndriving ethnic divisions and violence, and deepening impunity in the country. Political\nviolence is spiralling out of control at the inter-communal level but driven by national actors\nwho arm ethnic militias and paramilitary groups with military grade weapons using the\nostensible cover of cattle-raiding, which in turn leads to reprisals and revenge killings – all\nunder the cover and control of parties to the conflict in South Sudan.\nConflict in South Sudan should no longer be an option if millions of South Sudanese\nare to achieve their dream of freedom and a life of dignity. It is only the timely\nimplementation of an inclusive and holistic transitional justice process envisioned in Chapter\nV that can achieve this.\n\n",

The Group of Eminent Experts\nfound reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the conflict in Yemen are responsible\nfor pervasive and incessant international human rights law and international humanitarian\nlaw violations, many of which may amount to war crimes. The summary of these findings is\nincluded in A/HRC/45/6. In addition to highlighting the parties to the conflict responsible\nfor violations, the Group of Eminent Experts identified, where possible, potential\nperpetrators of crimes that may have been committed. A list of names of such individuals\nhas been submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on a strictly\nconfidential basis to assist with future accountability efforts.\nThe Group of Eminent Experts has taken into account the observations provided in\nrelation to its previous report by the Government of Yemen, de facto authorities, the Southern\nTransitional Council, the coalition and the United Arab Emirates. However, the Group of\nEminent Experts regrets that for a second consecutive year, it was not able to access Yemen\nand other coalition countries, despite having sent several requests for permission in January\nand February 2020. The Group of Eminent Experts directed specific questions to the parties\nto the conflict, but is yet to receive any response.\n\n* The information in this report should be read in conjunction with the Report of the Group of Eminent\nInternational and Regional Experts as submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/45/6).\n\n",
