Text-to-Text Datasets [in trainable-entity-extractor]:

| Dataset                 | Accuracy |
|-------------------------|----------|
| code_spanish            | 100      |
| document_code           | 100      |
| judge_name              | 98       |
| vote_english            | 100      |
| vote_in_favour_english  | 100      |
| vote_against_english    | 100      |
| vote_abstaining_english | 100      |


- "code_spanish" and "document_code" are for extracting documents code like "131/17".
- "judge_name" is for extracting judge names from the text.
- "vote_english" is for extracting "Adopted by vote" or "Adopted without a vote".
- "vote_in_favour_english", "vote_against_english" and "vote_abstaining_english" are for extracting the countries which are
in the "in favour", "against" or "abstaining" list.
- in judge_name dataset, the only mistake is because there are two judges, but model extracted one of them.
