Text-to-Text Datasets [in trainable-entity-extractor]:

| Dataset         | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| code_spanish    | 100      |
| document_code   | 100      |
| judge_name      | 98       |
| vote_english    | 100      |


- in judge_name dataset, the only mistake is because there are two judges, but model is able to extract one of them.
